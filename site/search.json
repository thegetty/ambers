[{"content":"This catalogue presents a group of remarkable amber carvings from the J. Paul Getty Museum’s collection—the second largest body of this material in the United States and one of the most important in the world. The fifty-six Etruscan, Greek, and Italic carved ambers date from around 650 to 300 B.C.\nOffering a full description of each piece, including typology, style, chronology, provenance, condition, and iconography, the catalogue is preceded by a general introduction to ancient amber. Through exquisite visual examples and vivid excerpts from classical texts, this book examines the myths and legends woven around amber—its employment in magic and medicine, its transport and carving, and its incorporation into jewelry, amulets, and other objects of prestige.\nThis open-access catalogue is available for free online and in multiple formats for download, including PDF, MOBI/Kindle, and EPUB.

Paul Getty Museum collection of amber antiquities was formed between 1971 and 1984. Apart from the Roman Head of Medusa (figure 1), which Mr. Getty acquired as part of a larger purchase of antiquities in 1971, all the other ancient amber objects were acquired as gifts. The collection is made up primarily of pre-Roman material, but also includes a small number of Roman-period carvings, of which the Head of Medusa is the most important. The pre-Roman material includes a variety of jewelry elements that date from the seventh to the fourth centuries B.C.: fifty-six figured works and approximately twelve hundred nonfigured beads, fibulae, and pendants. This volume examines the fifty-six objects of pre-Roman date representing human, animal, and fantastic creatures, plus a modern forgery. The Getty\u0026rsquo;s nonfigured pre-Roman objects and the Roman works are not included in this catalogue.\n Head of Medusa, Roman, A.D. 1st–2nd century.

Amber, H: 5.8 cm (2 3/10 in.), W: 5.8 cm (2 3/10 in.). Los Angeles, The J. Paul Getty Museum, 71.AO.355.    The ambers were acquired by their donors on the international art market. The loss of any artifact\u0026rsquo;s context is immeasurable, and any attempt to discuss ambers without their original context is, to borrow an analogy from Thorkild Jacobsen, “not unlike entering the world of poetry.” Poetry plays a part in locating the cultural ambients in which the ambers of this catalogue once performed. In addition to ancient literary sources, the work here is examined via a large interdisciplinary toolkit, including art history, archaeology, philology, pharmacology, anthropology, ethnology, and the history of medicine, religion, and magic.\nAt a critical moment in writing this introduction, I read two of Roger Moorey\u0026rsquo;s final contributions, his 2001 Schweich Lectures, Idols of the People: Miniature Images of Clay in the Ancient Near East (2003), and his Catalogue of the Ancient Near Eastern Terracottas in the Ashmolean (2004). Both were important to the final shaping of my text. (It is from the latter publication that I borrowed Jacobsen\u0026rsquo;s quotation.) Certain of Moorey\u0026rsquo;s observations played critical roles; among them is his cautionary note in the Catalogue: “Even if it may be possible to identify who or what is represented, whether it be natural or supernatural, that does not in itself resolve the question of what activity the terracotta was involved in.”1\nIndeed, in what “activity” were these carved ambers involved? This catalogue attempts to address this question. Keeping in mind the challenges presented when working with decontextualized artifacts, I make comparisons to scientifically excavated parallels, to documented works in museums, and, with extra care, to unprovenanced material in other collections, public and private. The evidence suggests that amber was dedicated primarily to female divinities, and that most pre-Roman amber objects were buried with women and children. Individually and as a whole, the Getty Museum\u0026rsquo;s amber objects are important witnesses to the larger social picture of the people who valued the material.2\nMy interest was first sparked by the peculiar nature of the carved amber on display in the British Museum and by Donald Strong\u0026rsquo;s masterful 1966 catalogue of the material.3 Strong duly noted the magical aspects of the subjects of Italian Iron Age ambers, and I took as a challenge one comment: “Many of the more enigmatic subjects among these carvings probably have a meaning that is no longer clear to us.”4\nNotes   Citation: Moorey 2004Moorey, R.

Personal ornaments, constructed of the rare, the sacred, the exotic, or the labor/skill intensive, are universally employed, indeed essential to distinguish people and peoples from each other.” White\u0026rsquo;s work on Paleolithic technology, the origins of material representation in Europe, and the aesthetics of Paleolithic adornment have informed this study more than any specific reference might indicate. Throughout his work, White underlines the variety, richness, and interpretive complexity of the known corpus of prehistoric representations. It is through his work that I began to understand the nonverbal aspects of adornment and to consider systems of personal ornamentation. See R. White, “Systems of Personal Ornamentation in the Early Upper Paleolithic: Methodological Challenges and New Observations,” in Rethinking the Human Revolution: New Behavioural and Biological Perspectives on the Origin and Dispersal of Modern Humans, eds.

Luquet, L\u0026rsquo;art et la religion des hommes fossiles (Paris, 1926). In the 2007 article, White publishes the earliest known amber pendant (the amber is almost certainly from Pyrenean foreland sources) from the Archaic Aurignacian level 4c6 at Isturitz, France. ↩ It has been more than forty years since the watershed publication of the British Museum catalogue of carved amber Citation: Strong 1966Strong, D. E. Catalogue of the Carved Amber in the Department of the Greek and Roman Antiquities. London, 1966.. Since that time, there has been considerable research on amber in the ancient world and related subjects, and a significant number of amber-specific studies have been published during the last several years. These range in type from exhibition and collection catalogues, excavation reports, and in-depth studies of individual works to broader sociocultural assessments. Still, many finds and investigations (including excavation reports) await publication, and the study of amber objects is behind that of other contemporary visual arts media. There are many reasons for this lag, including the nature of the material itself. Only a small number of carved amber objects are on display in public collections; relatively few are published or even illustrated; and too few come from controlled contexts. Many important works are in private collections and remain unstudied. Moreover, under some burial conditions, and because of its chemical and physical structure, amber often suffers over time. Poorly conserved pieces are friable, difficult to conserve and sometimes even to study; they can be handled only with great care and therefore are notoriously difficult to photograph, illustrate, or display. Much more remains to be learned about amber objects from a uniform application of scientific techniques, such as neutron activation analysis, infrared spectrometry, isotope C12/C13 determination, and pyrolysis mass spectrometry (PYMS), as recent research has demonstrated.

However, in the ancient world, as now, jewelry was never just jewelry. Today, throughout the world, jewelers, artisans, and merchants make or sell religious symbols, good-luck charms, evil eyes, birthstones, tiaras, mourning pins, wedding rings, and wristwatches. Jewelry can signal allegiance to another person, provide guidance, serve a talismanic function, ward away danger, or link the wearer to a system of orientation—as does a watch set to Greenwich Mean Time—or to ritual observances. Birthstones and zodiacal images can connect wearers to their planets and astrological signs. Certain items of jewelry serve as official insignia: for example, the crown jewels of a sovereign or the ring of the Pontifex Maximus. A cross or other religious symbol can demonstrate faith or an aspect of belief. Not only goldsmiths make jewelry; so also do healers and other practitioners with varying levels of skill. In the West today, most jewelry is made for the living; in other parts of the world, objects of adornment may be particular to the rituals of death and intended as permanent accompaniments for the deceased\u0026rsquo;s remains. Much jewelry, especially if figured, belongs to a phenomenology of images, and it functions in ritual ways. It is part of a social flow of information and can establish, modify, and comment on major social categories, such as age, sex, and status, since it has value, carries meaning, and suggests communication within groups, regions, and often larger geographical areas.\nUnderlying my discussion of ancient carved amber is the belief that jewelry (adornment and body ornamentation) is value-laden and that its form and material qualities (the ancient use of rare and exotic materials reflects labor, skill, and knowledge-intensive production) are powerful indicators of social identity. Permanent ornaments can endure beyond one human life and can connect their wearers to ancestors, thus playing a crucial role in social continuity—especially when we consider that such objects are imbued with an optical authority that words and actions often lack, or carry messages too dangerous or controversial to put into words. In life, in funeral rituals, and in the grave, the decoration of the body with amber jewelry and other body ornaments would have had a social function, solidifying a group\u0026rsquo;s belief systems and reiterating ideas about the afterworld. Perhaps more than any other aspect of the archaeological record, body ornamentation is a point of access into the social world of the past. Ethnographers see body ornamentation as affirming the social construct and structure and, when worn by the political elite, as guaranteeing group beliefs. Interpretations of the meanings of body ornamentation imagery must consider how “artistic” languages work to create expressive effects that are dependent upon the setting.\nJewelry is made to be worn; it is often bestowed or given as a gift at significant threshold dates; and it is regularly imbued with or accrues sentimental or status value because of the giver or a previous wearer or donor. In antiquity, jewelry also was given to the gods (figure 2). Dedications might be made at the transition to womanhood, following a successful birth, or in thanksgiving. Jewelry of gold, amber, ivory, or other precious materials might be placed on cult statues to form part of the statue\u0026rsquo;s kosmos, or embellishment. In notable cases, such embellishment was later renewed and the old material buried as deposits in sanctuaries.5\n Ring dedicated to Hera, Greek, ca. 575 B.C. Gilded silver, Diam.

Gilded silver, Diam. (outer): 2.2 cm (7/8 in.), Diam. (inner): 1.8 cm (11/16 in.). Los Angeles, The J. Paul Getty Museum, 85.AM.264.    Jewelry is one of the most powerful and pervasive forms in which humans construct and represent beliefs, values, and social identity. When made by artists or artisans of the highest skill, lifelike images can carry magical and dynamic religious properties and can even be highly charged ritual objects in their own right. Tiny carved amber images buried with people considered to be members of religious-political elites may well have played such a role.\nThe nature and role of amber-workers—jewelers, pharmacists, priests, “wise women,” and magicians—are critical to reading body ornaments. Not only the materials and subjects, but also the technology of jewelry-making, were integral to its effect. If the materials were precious and the making mythic or magical, the results were appropriate for the elite, including the gods. The concept of “maker” also includes supernatural entities, such as magician-gods and other mythic artisans. In the Greek-speaking world, the Iliad describes Hephaistos at work in his marine grotto, making arms, armor, and jewelry, elegant brooches, pins, bracelets, and necklaces. The god crafted Harmonia\u0026rsquo;s necklace and Pandora\u0026rsquo;s crown. Daidalos put his hand to all sorts of creations and gave his name to one of the most famous of all Greek objects of adornment: Odysseus\u0026rsquo;s brooch.6\nThis said, there is a problem with the language. The modern word jewelry is, in the end, limiting and fails to encompass the full significance of the carved ambers. The terms ornament and body ornamentation, adornment and object of adornment, too, are problematic. One of the more accurate terms, amulet (figure 3), is also loaded, as it is situated on a much-discussed crossroads among magic, medicine, ritual, and religion. Amulet is a modern word, derived from the Latin amuletum, used to describe a powerful or protective personal object worn or carried on the person. “Because of its shape, the material from which it is made, or even just its color,” an amulet “is believed to endow its wearer by magical means with certain powers and capabilities.”7\n Amber necklaces and gold ornaments from the young girl’s Tomb 102, Braida di Serra di Vaglio, Italy, ca. 500 B.C.

Ogden, Greek Gold: Jewelry of the Classical World (London, 1994), pp. 31–32.↩ Many figured ambers might have been brought to an ancient Greek-speaking viewer's mind by the words daidalon, kosmos, and agalma, specifically the daidalon worn by Odysseus: a gold brooch animated with the image of a hound holding a dappled fawn in its forepaws, the fawn struggling to flee (Odyssey 19.225–31). Sarah Morris first brought this example to my attention. See S. P. Morris, Daidalos and the Origins of Greek Art (Princeton, 1992), esp. pp. 27–29. See also Citation: Steiner 2001Steiner, D. T. Images in Mind: Statues in Archaic and Classical Greek Literature and Thought. Princeton, 2001., pp. 20–21 ; and F. Frontisi-Ducroux, Dédale: Mythologie de l'artisan en Grèce ancienne (Paris, 2000).\nWhat M. J. Bennett (Citation: Langdon 1993Langdon, S., ed. From Pasture to Polis: Art in the Age of Homer. Exh. cat. Columbia, MO, 1993., pp. 78–80) writes about Greek Geometric plate fibulae might be applicable to other contemporary and later precious figured ornaments in the Greek-speaking world. Objects with complex imagery might reflect “the ordering of the world (cosmos) … considering that cosmos meant ‘the universe,’ ‘order,’ ‘good behavior,’ as well as ‘a piece of jewelry,’ the fibula was not a mere fashion accessory, but rather a sophisticated ontological statement.” G. F. Pinney, Figures of Speech: Men and Maidens in Ancient Greece (Chicago, 2002), p. 53, with reference to Hesiod's Theogony 581–84, writes: “The vocabulary of kosmos makes ample use of words for splendor and light: lampein, phaeinos, aglaos, sigaloeis.” The point is glamour in the form of radiance, light emanating from shimmering cloth and gleaming metals.\nAgalma occupied distinct but related semantic areas in Greek, as Citation: Keesling 2003Keesling, C. M. The Votive Statues of the Athenian Acropolis. New York, 2003., p. 10, describes: “Agalma could designate any pleasing ornament, or a pleasing ornament dedicated to the gods. In the fifth century, Herodotus used agalma to refer specifically to statues, the agalmata par excellence displayed in the sanctuaries of his time.” M. C. Stieber, The Poetics of Appearance in the Attic Korai (Austin, TX, 2004), is illuminating as she probes agalma for the sculptures and their accoutrements in her discussion of the kore as an agalma for the goddess and the korai as agalmata in and of themselves. She reminds us that the term is used of real women in literature (Helen of Troy and Iphigenia in Aeschylus's Agamemnon 7.41 and 208, respectively).↩\n Citation: Andrews 1994Andrews, C. Amulets of Ancient Egypt. Austin, TX, 1994., p. 6. The literature on amulets, amuletic practice, magic, and ritual practice in the ancient world is vast. The term magic is used here in its broadest and most positive sense. Although M. Dickie and others argue that magic did not exist as a separate category of thought in Greece before the fifth century, practices later subsumed under the term did, especially the use of amulets. The use of amulets implies a continuing relationship between the object and the wearer, continuing enactment, and the role of at least one kind of practitioner. Citation: Dickie 2001Dickie, M. Magic and Magicians in the Greco-Roman World. New York, 2001., p. 130, concludes that the existence and wide use of amulets in Rome by the Late Republic “leads us back into a hidden world of experts in the rituals of the manufacture and application of amulets, not to speak of those who sold them.” Pliny uses three words to describe amber items used in medicine, protection, and healing: amuletum, monile (for a necklace), and alligatum, when citing Callistratus. Greek terms for amulet include periamma and periapta.

The Greek recipes in the Papyri Graecae Magicae use the latter term.\nIn early Greece, as elsewhere earlier in the Mediterranean world, an amulet was applied in conjunction with an incantation, as Kotansky (ibid.) describes. Incantations required the participation of skilled practitioners and a receptive participant. Socrates, in Plato's Republic, lists amulets and incantations as among the techniques used to heal the sick, a tradition that continued at least into the Late Antique period. Galen, for example, sanctions the use of incantations by doctors (Citation: Dickie 2001Dickie, M. Magic and Magicians in the Greco-Roman World.

In Egypt, an amulet could at the very least, as Citation: Andrews 1994Andrews, C. Amulets of Ancient Egypt. Austin, TX, 1994., p. 6, summarizes:\nafford some kind of magical protection, a concept confirmed by the fact that three of the four Egyptian words translate as “amulet,” namely mkt (meket), nht (nehet) and s3 (sa) come primarily from verbs meaning “to guard” or “to protect.” The fourth, wd3 (wedja), has the same sound as the word meaning well-being. For the ancient Egyptian, amulets and jewelry [that] incorporate amuletic forms were an essential adornment, especially as part of the funerary equipment for the dead, but also in the costume of the living. Moreover, many of the amulets and pieces of amuletic jewelry worn in life for their magical properties could be taken to the tomb for use in the life after death. Funerary amulets, however, and prescribed funerary jewelry which was purely amuletic in function, were made expressly for setting on the wrapped mummy on the day of the burial to provide aid and protection on the fraught journey to the Other world and ease in the Afterlife. In the ancient Near East, the great variety of human problems handled by recourse to amulets is already well documented in the Early Dynastic period. See B. L. Goff, Symbols of Prehistoric Mesopotamia (New Haven and London, 1963), esp. chap. 9, “The Role of Amulets in Mesopotamian Ritual Texts,” pp. 162–211. The role of magic as described in Assyro-Babylonian elite literature is relevant: magic was prescribed and overtly practiced for the benefit of king, court, and important individuals; it was not marginal and clandestine; and only noxious witchcraft was forbidden and prosecuted. See E. Reiner, Astral Magic in Babylonia (Chicago, 1995).\nKeeping in mind the cultural variants of death and burial rituals in the places and periods under consideration here, there may have been a considerable lag between death and the readying of the corpse, including cremation, excarnation, or other preparations before burial rituals. The production of sumptuary and ritualistic objects suggests the existence of specialists (religious-ceremonial or political-ceremonial) who themselves may have used insignia associated with their positions.↩\n   ","id":3,"length":2638,"title":"Jewelry","type":"essay","url":"https://gettypubs.github.io/ambers/intro/2/"},{"content":"While magic is probably the one word broad enough to describe the ancient use of amulets, the modern public finds the term difficult. As H. S. Versnel puts it, “One problem is that you cannot talk about magic without using the term magic.”8\nBut even if it were possible to draw precise lines of demarcation between the ancient use of amber for adornment and its role in healing, between its reputation for warding off danger and its connection to certain divinities and cults, such categorizations would run counter to an understanding of amber in its wider context. Amber\u0026rsquo;s beauty and rarity were evident to an ancient observer, but its magnetic properties, distinctive, glowing, sunlike color and liquid appearance, inclusions and luster, and exotic origins were mysterious and awe-inspiring. Amber\u0026rsquo;s fascination and associative value prompted a wide range of overlapping uses.9 Pliny the Elder, for instance, put together an impressive list of uses for amber, including as a medicine for throat problems and as a charm for protecting babies.10 Diodorus Siculus noted amber\u0026rsquo;s role in mourning rituals, and Pausanias guided visitors to an amber statue of Augustus at Olympia. The main sources of amber in antiquity were at the edges of the known world, and those distant lands generated further rich lore. Myths and realities of amber\u0026rsquo;s nature and power influenced the desire to acquire it. As the historian Joan Evans has observed, “Rarity, strangeness, and beauty have in them an inexplicable element and the inexplicable is always potentially magical.”11 Beliefs about amber\u0026rsquo;s mysterious origins and unique physical and optical properties affected the ways it was used in antiquity and the forms and subjects into which it was carved.12\nExcavations during the last half century, especially in Italy, have greatly improved our understanding of how amber functioned in funerary contexts. The emerging picture is also enhancing our understanding of how amber objects were used before their burial. A number of amber pendants, including the Getty objects, show signs of wear (figure 4). Unfortunately, we can only speculate as to whether the ambers were actually possessions of the people with whom they were buried, how the objects were acquired, and in which cultic or other activity they played a part. There is no written source until Pliny the Elder, around A.D. 79, to tell us how amber was used in life (in a religious, medical, magical, or other context).13 Only a few fragments of information from early Christian sources add to the Roman picture. All evidence before Pliny is archaeological and extrapolated from earlier sources—from Egypt, the Aegean, the ancient Near East, and northern Europe. In Egypt, and to a lesser extent in the ancient Near East, much more is known about how amuletic jewelry was produced, and by whom and for whom it was produced. In both regions, we find instances of amulets specifically designed for funerary use and of previously owned amulets continuing their usefulness in the tomb.\n Female Head in Profile Pendant, Italic, 500–480 B.C.

We might also ask how amber pendants in the form of age-old subjects (goddesses [figure 5], animals, or solar and lunar symbols) relate to older traditions. In the ancient Near East, Kim Benzel reminds us, symbolic jewelry pendants signified emblematic forms of major deities from as early as the third millennium B.C.:\n Symbols of divinities have a long tradition of representation in various media throughout the ancient Near East. They were certainly meant to be apotropaic, but likely had far greater efficacy than the purely protective. An emblem was considered one mode of presencing a deity.… The power embodied in [such] ornaments thus would have been \u0026gt; analogous to the power embedded in a cult statue—which is perhaps why in the later religions, along with idol worship, jewels were banned. 14\n  Addorsed Females Pendant, Etruscan, 600–550 B.C.

The subjects of the Getty pre-Roman figured ambers vary, but without exception, they incorporate a protective as well as a fertility or regenerative aspect.15 It is easy to see that the same amulet that had helped to ensure safe entry into the world of the living could serve a similar function in smoothing the transition into the afterworld, or world of the dead. Many images allude to a journey (figure 6) that the deceased\u0026rsquo;s shade, or soul, takes after death, and these pieces are difficult to see as intended for the living: these must have been gifts or commissions specifically for the dead. The ambers that show wear do not indicate who used them. While there is no direct evidence as to whether the amulets found in burials were owned by the deceased during their lives, it is tempting to assume that this could have been the case. Were they purchases, part of a dowry, heirlooms, or other kinds of gifts? Ambers were made, at some point, for someone, whether bought on the open market or commissioned to order. Inscribed Greek magical amulets (lamellae) “that had been commissioned for specific purposes (or most feared dangers) came to represent for their wearer a multivalent protection, a sine qua non for every activity in life. And in the face of the liminal dangers of the afterlife passage … this same amulet that had come to protect all aspects of life would now be considered crucial in death, the apotropaic token of the soul.”16\n Ship with Figures Pendant, Etruscan, 600–575 B.C.

Some amber pendants are both worn and “old-fashioned” for the context in which they were found, and they cause us to remember that in antiquity there was a well-established tradition of gift giving during life and at the grave.17 Figured ambers, including those in the Getty collection, may have been worn regularly in life for permanent protection or benefit; others, on a temporary basis or in crises, such as childbirth, illness, or a dangerous journey. Others may have been grave gifts or offerings to divinities, perhaps to propitiate underworld deities. In some cases, deceased girls may have been adorned as brides—a common aspect of funerary ritual.\nHow these objects might have functioned in reference to clanship or other social identities, either during life or the rituals surrounding death, should also be considered. Among certain populations, there might have been a generally accepted role for amber, in both the range of subjects into which it was formed and/or the objects it embellished. Some subjects might have been pertinent to clans or larger communities, in the way that shield emblazons might be. Some imagery might have been special to family groups, who may have traced their origins, names, or even good fortune to a particular deity, animal, totem, or myth. If an elite person whose family\u0026rsquo;s founder was a divinity or Homeric hero was buried with a ring with an engraved gem representing, say, Herakles (figure 7), Odysseus, or Athena, might the same have been done with figured ambers?\n Engraved Scarab with Herakles, Etruscan, 400–380 B.C.

Los Angeles, The J. Paul Getty Museum, 85.AN.123.    The extent to which some of these ornament-amulets had a role in established cult or folk religion is difficult to ascertain, but it should not be either exaggerated or denied. The diversity of subjects that appear in figured amber over time suggests that the material was used within many different symbol systems, but always for its protective or regenerative aspects. Some pieces do incorporate elements relating, for instance, to Dionysos or Artemis, but as such, they occupy a hazy territory between identifiable religious practices and what Einar Thomassen calls “the appropriation of ritual power for personal ends.”18 The use of these amulets may have been dictated to some extent by skilled practitioners, but it is likely that the original, specific use of a protective amulet often would have eroded into a more generalized portafortuna, or good-luck, role over time.19 The generally feared evil eye might have been warded off with any amber amulet.20\nWorked amber and amber jewelry were well in evidence in northern Europe from the fourth millennium B.C. onward. The earliest evidence for worked amber in Italy is from the Bronze Age. We do not know where the amber found in graves dating to circa 1500 B.C. in Basilicata (near Melfi and Matera) was carved. In the later Bronze Age, Adriatic Frattesina, a typical emporium of the protohistoric era, was a place of manufacture. Already by this time, variety in style, subject, technique, and function was evident. Some of these early ambers are the work of highly skilled artisans; others are rudimentary in manufacture and indicate work by other kinds of amber-workers/amuletmakers, perhaps even priestesses, physicians, or “wise women.” It is tempting to think of multiple ritual specialists involved in amber-working and amuletmaking, though perhaps in not so pronounced a fashion as in contemporary Egypt—although there is evidence for widespread amuletic usage in Italy even into modern times. We might well envision a scenario that includes simple gem cutters, sculptors, multiple ritual specialists—from healers to hacks—those with fixed locations in urban settings, and itinerants. Such a variety of practitioners offering objects and ritual expertise is likely, especially for amulets in a material as inherently magical as amber.21\nNotes Reference from E.

Modern Westerners tend to discuss the fertility and fecundity beliefs and rites of earlier peoples in the context of an increase of humans, hunt animals, edible botanics, agricultural products, and domesticated crops, which limits our understanding of fertility imagery, both its making and its use. That fertility magic was used to control reproduction (via, e.g., birth spacing) as well as spur procreation was first brought to my attention by R. White (public lecture 1999). See White 2003 (n. 2), p. 58, where he cites G. H. Luquet, L'art néo-calédonien: Documents recueillis par Marius Archambault (Paris, 1926), and P. Ucko and A. Rosenfeld, Paleolithic Cave Art (London, 1967). Luquet was among the first to raise doubts about the idea that Paleolithic peoples were motivated to increase human fecundity through magical acts. Ucko and Rosenfeld were among the first to write that hunters and gatherers are generally more interested in limiting population growth than in increasing it. Compare the discussion by J. Assante, “From Whores to Hierodules,” in Ancient Art and Its Historiography, ed. A. A. Donohue and M. D.

Although previous ownership of excavated objects is ordinarily difficult to establish, two Etruscan finds and one Etrusco-Campanian find might be seen as exempla of presentation, parting, and exchange articulated around banquets.

The seventh-century gold fibula, with its inscription in granulation, from Casteluccio-La Foce (Siena), in the Louvre (Bj 816), is a gift-ornament that recalls the fibulae of the peplos offered to Penelope (Odyssey 18.292–95).

The problems begin with the names by which the material is known: amber, Baltic amber, fossil resin, succinite, and resinite. Although all these terms have been used to describe the material discussed in this catalogue, they have confused as much as they have clarified. It is generally accepted that amber is derived from resin-bearing trees that once clustered in dense, now extinct forests.22 Despite decades of study, there is no definite conclusion about the botanical source of the vast deposits of Baltic amber, as Jean H. Langenheim recently summarized in her compendium on plant resins:\n It is clear that the amber is not derived from the modern species of Pinus, but there are mixed signals from suggestions of either an araucarian Agathis-like or a pinaceous Pseudolarix-like resin producing tree.… Although the evidence appears to lean more \u0026gt; toward a pinaceous source, an extinct ancestral tree is probably the only solution. 23\n Geologically, amber has been documented throughout the world (figure 8), with most deposits found in Tertiary-period sediments dating to the Eocene, a few to the Oligocene and Miocene, and fewer still to later in the Tertiary. Amber is formed from resin exuded from treebark (figure 9), although it is also produced in the heartwood. Resin protects trees by blocking gaps in the bark. Once resin covers a gash or break caused by chewing insects, it hardens and forms a seal. Resin\u0026rsquo;s antiseptic properties protect the tree from disease, and its stickiness can gum up the jaws of gnawing and burrowing insects.24 In the primordial “amber forest,” resin oozed down trunks and branches and formed into blobs, sheets, and stalactites, sometimes dripping onto the forest floor. On some trees, exuded resin flowed over previous flows, creating layers. The sticky substance collected detritus and soil and sometimes entrapped flying and crawling creatures (figure 10). Eventually, after the trees fell, the resin-coated logs were carried by rivers and tides to deltas in coastal regions, where they were buried over time in sedimentary deposits. Most amber did not originate in the place where it was found; often, it was deposited and found at a distance from where the resin-producing trees grew. Most known accumulations of amber are redepositions, the result of geological activity.25\n Sources of Amber in the Ancient World.

Grimaldi/American Museum of Natural History     Chemically, the resin that became amber originally contained liquids (volatiles) such as oils, acids, and alcohols, including aromatic compounds (terpenes) that produce amber\u0026rsquo;s distinctive resinous smell.26 Over time, the liquids dissipated and evaporated from the resin, which began to harden as the organic molecules joined to form much larger ones called polymers. Under the right conditions, the hardened resin continued to polymerize and lose volatiles, eventually forming amber, an inert solid that, when completely polymerized, has no volatiles.27 Most important, the resins that became amber were buried in virtually oxygen-free sediments.\nHow long does it take for buried resin to become amber? The amberization process is a continuum extending from freshly hardened resins to rocklike ones, and, as David Grimaldi points out, “No single feature identifies at what age along that continuum the substance becomes amber.”28 Langenheim explains: “With increasing age, the maturity of any given resin will increase, but the rate at which it occurs depends on the prevailing geologic conditions as well as the composition of the resin.… Changes appear to be a response primarily to geothermal stress since chemical change in the resin accelerates at higher temperatures.”29\nWhile some experts maintain that only material that is several million years old or older is sufficiently cross-linked and polymerized to be classified as amber, others opt for a date as recent as forty thousand years before the present.30 Much depends on the soil conditions of the resin\u0026rsquo;s burial. In its final form, amber is much more stable than the original substance. Amber is organic, like petrified wood or dinosaur bones, but, unlike those substances, it retains its chemical composition over time, and that is why some experts resist calling it a fossil resin (a nevertheless useful term).31 Amber can also preserve plant matter (figure 11), bacteria, fungi, worms, snails, insects, spiders, and (more rarely) small vertebrates. Some pieces of amber contain water droplets and bubbles, products of the chemical breakdown of organic matter. It is not entirely understood how resins preserve organic matter, but presumably the chemical features of amber that preserve it over millennia also preserve flora and fauna inside it.32 It must be that amber\u0026rsquo;s “amazing life-like fidelity of preservation … occurs through rapid and thorough fixation and inert dehydration as well as other natural embalming properties of the resin that are still not understood.”33 The highly complex process that results in amber formation gave rise to a wealth of speculation about its nature and origins. Whence came a substance that carried within it the flora and fauna of another place and time, one with traces of the earth and sea, one that seemed even to hold the light of the sun?\n Cone in Baltic amber, L: 15.2 cm (6 in.).

Of the many kinds of amber found in the Old World, the most plentiful today, as in antiquity, is Baltic amber (figure 12), or succinite (so called because it has a high concentration of succinic acid). This early Tertiary (Upper Eocene–Lower Oligocene) amber comes mainly from around the shores of the Baltic Sea, from today\u0026rsquo;s Lithuania, Latvia, Russia (Kaliningrad), Poland, southern Sweden, northern Germany, and Denmark. The richest deposits are on and around the Samland peninsula, a large, fan-shaped area that corresponds to the delta region of a river that once drained an ancient landmass that geologists call Fennoscandia. This ancient continent now lies beneath the Baltic Sea and the surrounding land. Although this area has the largest concentration of amber in the world, it is a secondary deposition. Amazingly, the fossil resin “was apparently eroded from marine sediments near sea level, carried ashore during storms, and subsequently carried by water and glaciers to secondary deposits across much of northern and eastern Europe” over a period of approximately twenty million years.34 In antiquity, most amber from the Baltic shore was harvested from shallow waters and beaches, where it had washed up (once again, millennia later), especially during autumn storms that agitated the seabeds. It was only in the early modern period that amber began to be mined. With the introduction of industrial techniques, huge amounts have been extracted since the nineteenth century. It is estimated that up to a million pounds of amber a year was dug from the blue earth layer of the Samland peninsula in the first decades of the twentieth century.35\n Baltic amber.

Ewing     Other kinds of amber used by ancient Mediterranean peoples have been identified with sources in today\u0026rsquo;s Sicily,36 Lebanon, Israel, and Jordan.37 In addition to European sources, ancient accounts mention amber from Liguria, Scythia,38 Syria, India, Ethiopia, and Numidia. However, of the varieties used in antiquity and known today, only succinite, or Baltic amber, is found in the large, relatively sturdy jewelry-grade pieces such as were used for the sizable objects of antiquity, like the pre-Roman pendants of this catalogue, or for the complex carvings, vessels, and containers of Roman date. Small pieces of amber and the wastage of larger compositions could have been used for tiny carvings and other purposes. Non-jewelry-grade amber would also have been employed in inlay, incense and perfume, pharmaceuticals, and varnish, as is still the case in the modern period. Burmite (found in Burma, now Myanmar) and some amber from China, types also found in large, high-grade pieces, have long histories of artistic and other uses in Asia.39\nNotes Citation: Langenheim 2003Langenheim, J.

If it was dug up rather than originating in an oceanic or riverine source, it may not have had the same value.

Amber may be transparent or cloudy, depending on the presence and number of air bubbles (figure 13). It frequently contains large numbers of microscopic air bubbles, allowing it to float and to be easily carried by rivers or the sea. White opaque Baltic amber may contain as many as 900,000 minuscule air bubbles per square millimeter and floats in fresh water. Clear Baltic amber sinks in fresh water but is buoyant in saltwater. Baltic amber has some distinguishing characteristics rarely found in other types of amber: it commonly contains tiny hairs that probably came from the male flowers of oak trees, and tiny pyrite crystals often fill cracks and inclusions. Another feature found in Baltic amber is the white coating partly surrounding some insect inclusions, formed from liquids that escaped from the decaying insects.40\n Extinct termite, Mastotermes electrodominicus, in Dominican amber.

Grimaldi/American Museum of Natural History     Amber\u0026rsquo;s hardness varies from 2 to 3 on the Mohs scale (talc is 1 and diamond 10). This relative softness means that amber is easily worked. It has a melting-point range of 200 to 380°C, but it tends to burn rather than melt. Amber is amorphous in structure and, if broken, can produce a conchoidal, or shell-like, fracture. It is a poor conductor and thus feels warm to the touch in the cold, and cool in the heat. When friction is applied, amber becomes negatively charged and attracts lightweight particles such as pieces of straw, fluff, or dried leaves. Its ability to produce static electricity has fascinated observers from earliest times. Amber\u0026rsquo;s magnetic property gave rise to the word electricity: amber (Greek, elektron) was used in the earliest experiments on electricity.41 Amber\u0026rsquo;s natural properties inspired myth and legend and dictated its usage.\nIn antiquity, before the development of colorless clear glass, a complex technique perfected in the Hellenistic period, the clear materials known were natural ones: water and some other liquids; ice; boiled honey and some oils; rock crystal; some precious stones; and amber.42 Transparent amber is a natural magnifier, and, when formed into a regularly curved surface and given a high polish, it can act as a lens.43 A clear piece of amber with a convex surface can concentrate the sun\u0026rsquo;s rays. One ancient source suggests that such polished ambers were used as burning lenses.\nOnce cleaned of its outer layers and exposed to air, amber\u0026rsquo;s appearance—its color, degree of transparency, and surface texture—eventually will change. As a result of the action of oxygen upon the organic material, amber will darken: a clear piece will become yellow; a honey-colored piece will become red, orange-red, or red-brown, and the surface progressively will become more opaque (figure 14).44 Oxidation commences quite quickly and starts at the surface, which is why some amber may appear opaque or dark on its surface and translucent at breaks or when subjected to transmitted light. However, the progress of oxidation is variable and depends on the time of exposure and other factors, such as the amount and duration of exposure to light. In archaeologically recovered amber, the state of the material is dependent upon burial conditions, and the degree of oxidation can vary widely, as the Getty collection reveals. The breakdown of the cortex causes cracking, fissuring, flaking, chipping, and, eventually, fractures. Only a very few ancient pieces retain something of their original appearance, in each case because of the oxygen-free environments in which they were buried. For instance, two fifth-century B.C. female head-pendants that were excavated at waterlogged Spina are remarkable for their clear, pale yellow color (figure 15).45 A large group of seventh-century B.C. amber-embellished objects from the cemeteries of Podere Lippi and Moroni-Semprini in Verucchio (Romagna) were preserved along with other perishable objects by the stable anaerobic conditions of the Verucchio tombs, which had been sealed with a mixture of water and clay (figure 16).46 Various colors and degrees of transparency are in evidence, from pale, clear yellow to clear orange or red to opaque yellows, oranges, reds, and tans. Inclusions are common.\n Two typical pieces of Baltic amber. Pale yellow amber was preferred by the ancient Greeks and Etruscans. Opaque orange amber was especially fashionable in Imperial Rome.

Gilbert, physician at the court of Queen Elizabeth I, to describe this property in his 1600 book On the Magnet, Magnetic Bodies and That Great Magnet the Earth.\nThe early Greek philosopher Thales of Miletos is credited by Diogenes Laertius as the first to recognize amber's magnetism: “Arguing from the magnet and from amber, he attributed a soul or life even to inanimate objects”: Diogenes Laertius 1.24, vol. 1, ed. and trans. R. D. Hicks, Loeb Classical Library 184 (London, 1993). E. R. Caley and J. C. Richards, Theophrastus on Stones (Columbus, 1956), p. 117, argue that this claim rests on shaky ground; that Thales was the first to mention the property can be inferred only indirectly from Diogenes Laertius's statement: “Aristotle and Hippias say that, judging by the behaviour of the lodestone and amber, he also attributed souls to lifeless things.” Caley and Richards consider the possibility “that it was Hippias who said that Thales understood the attractive property of amber, but there is no way of confirming such an inference because the works of Hippias are not extant.” Plato (Timaeus 80c) alludes to amber's magnetism but denies that it is a real power of attraction. Aristotle does not mention amber in the relevant section of On the Soul (De Anima 1.2.405A). Thus, following Caley and Richards, Theophrastus is the earliest extant account. If Thales did describe amber's static electricity, he may have done so based on his observation of wool production, which used amber implements: distaff, spindle, and whorls. I owe this observation to Citation: Schwarzenberg 2001Schwarzenberg, E. “L\u0026rsquo;ambre: du mythe à l’épigramme.” Revue des études anciennes 24 (2001): 33–67., who calls attention not only to the famous wool of Miletos, but also to the number of extant seventh-century spinning tools. Pliny notes that Syrian women used amber whorls in weaving and that amber picks up the “fringes of garments,” and also comments on amber's electrostatic property. But, unlike Plato, he thinks its magnetic property is like that of iron. Plutarch (Platonic Questions 7.7) explains that “the hot exhalation released by rubbing amber acts in the same ways as the emanations from the magnet. That is, it displaces air, forming a vacuum in front of the attracted object and driving air to the rear of it”: De Lapidibus, ed. and trans. D. E. Eichholz (Oxford, 1965), p. 200, n.b.↩\n Clear colorless glass (with antimony used as the decolorizing agent) is documented in the eighth century B.C. in western Asia and again in the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. in Greece. In Egypt, the use of manganese as a decolorizing agent became common in the first century; see E. M. Stern and B. Schlick-Nolte, Early Glass of the Ancient World, 1600 B.C.–a.d. 50: Ernesto Wolf Collection (Ostfildern, Germany, 1994), p. 20.↩ For an excellent overview of lenses and their ancient employment, see Citation: Plantzos 1999Plantzos, D.

According to Citation: Plantzos 1999Plantzos, D. Hellenistic Engraved Gems. New York, 1999., p. 41, “The discovery of crystals that could have served as magnifying lenses has been reported from Bronze Age sites, and although no similar objects can be dated to the Hellenistic period, some exist from Roman contexts.” He also points out (p. 41) that “developments in optics already in the Classical period suggest the possibility of magnifying lenses.” Various ancient authors describe the magnification of objects: Aristotle (Posterior Analytics 1.31) and Theophrastus (On Fire 73) observe “that convex pieces of glass can concentrate the sunrays, and light fire … and an earlier reference in Aristophanes (*Clouds* 766–75) indicates how well observed [this] was.” “For a lens to be able to contract light, a piece of glass with [a] regularly curved surface and a minimum diameter of around four centimeters was needed. Such a lens will have a short focus (between six and nine millimeters) and will therefore be quite useless as a general eye aid, but quite appropriate for a magnifying glass” (ibid.). Although no ancient literary source mentions amber's natural magnifying property, it is difficult to imagine that it went unnoticed. Many bulla-shaped amber pendants (of as early as seventh-century date) have regularly curved surfaces and are the right size to use as magnifiers, especially if the resin were clear. (On amber bullae, see n. 152.) The various techniques necessary to make a clear magnifying or burning lens from amber apparently were available by the first century A.D. The carving and polishing tools and technology were age-old, and as for the clarification process, Pliny relates a technique for “dressing” amber by boiling it in the fat of a suckling pig, a necessary step in making imitation transparent gemstones from amber, which Pliny also describes. A section of an entry in the Byzantine Suda (Hualê) may not refer to a glass lens, but rather to an amber one: “[A glass] is a round-shaped device of amber glass, contrived for the following purpose: when they have soaked it in oil and heated it in the sun they introduce a wick and kindle [fire]. So the old man is saying, in conversation with Socrates: if I were to start a fire with the amber and introduce fire to the tablet of the letter, I could make the letters of the lawsuit disappear.” See “Hualê,” trans. David Whitehead, March 19, 2006. Suda On Line: www.stoa.org/sol-entries/upsilon/6 (accessed November 27, 2009).\nProcessed (boiled, molded, and then ground) amber lenses are described by the end of the seventeenth century. In 1691, C. Porshin of Königsberg invented an amber burning glass, which was said to be better than the glass kind; he also used amber to make spectacles. See O. Faber, L. B. Frandsen, and M.

Cambridge, 1996., p. 32): “Mirrors, therefore, were not simply items in which one could see one's reflection, but were overlaid with symbolism relating to fertility and also health, and were surely believed to protect the user in this life. However, like the fertility figurine, they usually had a funerary function, too. Many mirrors have been found in burials, and it can be deduced that their positive symbolism would also have been regarded as helping the deceased to achieve rebirth into the afterlife.” The mirror was a type of object closely equated with the disk of the sun as well as with that of the moon, but its distinctive Egyptian form is most like that of the visible sun. See n. 161, on the connection of mirrors and the sun and the possibility of drawing down the power of the sun.↩\n Citation: Winter 1994Winter, I.

Today, although amber is still widely sought out for jewelry, magic, and medicine, its floral and faunal inclusions may be its greatest attraction (as reflected in the title of the 1996 exhibition and book Amber: Window to the Past). There is scarce textual evidence before Roman times to indicate an ancient fascination with the creatures and plant remains interred within amber; however, its use in burials may be evidence enough.\nThe standard Greek word for amber was elektron.52 The derivation of this word is uncertain, although scholars have suggested that it might have connections with helko, meaning “to draw or attract,” or with aleko, meaning “to ward off evil.”53 The word is certainly associated with elektor, used in the Iliad to mean “the beaming sun,”54 and is most likely derived from an Indo-European verb with the root-meanings “brilliant” or “to shine.” This quality of beaming, or reflecting the sun, is also suggested by the Germanic word for amber, glaes or glese, recorded in some ancient Latin sources as glaesum, the same word used for glass in this period.55 The Indo-Germanic root for this word, *ghel, means “lustrous, shimmering, or bright” and gives us words such as glisten, glitter, glow, and yellow in English. The current German word for amber, going back to thirteenth-century Middle Low German, is similarly evocative: Bernstein means “burning stone.”56\nWhen the Pliny the Elder or one of his contemporaries admired a valuable piece of amber, the first thing to strike their eyes would have been the suggestion of fire (imagine igneam) or the material\u0026rsquo;s gentle glow (mollis fulgor). The amber\u0026rsquo;s color was certainly evocative—of wine, honey, wax, embers, or fire—but was of secondary importance to its shine. This glow had been the defining characteristic of amber for centuries.\nBrilliance in amber, ice, rock crystal, or any stone was possible only because of its transparency. The ancients believed that transparency was possible because light was let through a material: thus transparent materials had performative powers.57 The brilliance of amber, enhanced by the rich connotations of its names, ensured it a place in ancient literature alongside other rare, prized, and luminous materials—sight-arresting materials such as gold, silver, and ivory, whose magnificence often was associated with something beyond the merely human, with the heroic or divine.58 This association is evident from the first extant occurrences of elektron in Homer\u0026rsquo;s Odyssey.59 When Telemachus visits Menelaus\u0026rsquo;s palace in Book 4, he is awestruck: “Mark the flashing of bronze throughout the echoing halls, and the flashing of gold, of amber, of silver, and of ivory. Of such sort, methinks, is the court of Olympian Zeus within, such untold wealth is here; amazement holds me as I look.”60\nIt is the flashing of the jewels, more so than the jewels themselves, that puts Telemachus in mind of Zeus; the word he uses is *steroph*—the flash of a lightning bolt. Telemachus\u0026rsquo;s association of the brightness, the shine, the brilliance of Menelaus\u0026rsquo;s palace with divinity seems almost instinctive.\nElektron occurs two other times in the Odyssey: once in Book 15, when the swineherd Eumaeus, telling the story of his kidnapping to Odysseus, remembers the cunning Phoenician mariner who turned up at his ancestral home with an eye-catching golden necklace strung with amber pieces.61 In addition, in Book 18, when the suitors vie with one another in the extravagance of their gifts to Penelope, Eurymachus\u0026rsquo;s contribution is “a richly crafted necklace of gold adorned with sun-bright amber” (figure 19).62 Another early occurrence of elektron is in the Pseudo-Hesiodic Shield of Herakles. In this passage, as in Homer\u0026rsquo;s description of Menelaus\u0026rsquo;s palace, amber takes its place in a list of rare and precious materials, to dazzling effect: “He took his glittering shield in his hands, nor had anyone ever broken it or damaged it with a blow; it was a marvel to see. The whole orb glowed with enamel, white ivory, and amber, and it shone with gleaming gold.”63\n Necklace with a Pendant Scarab, Italic or Etruscan, 550–400 B.C. Amber, gold, and carnelian.

L: 39.5 cm (15 9/16 in.). Los Angeles, The J. Paul Getty Museum, 77.AO.77.1.    In each of these passages referring to the use of amber—the ornamentation of a seemingly Olympian palace, necklaces intended for elite women, and the shield of a hero—amber is inextricably bound up with the light of the sun, and it is associated with gods, heroes, and a social elite. The reflection of sunlight, in the halls of a king or on the armor of a hero, was a powerful reminder of the heavens and the heavenly; brilliance and luster were primary qualities to be looked for in a precious material such as gold, ivory, silver, or amber. The brilliance of the amber and other materials in Herakles\u0026rsquo; shield, combined with the perfect craftsmanship that it represented, calls attention to its poikilia, the adornment and embellishment all fine works should display, and made it a thauma idesthai, a “marvel to behold”—what Raymond Prier has defined as “an intermediation between the polarities of men and gods, visually linguistic symbols of power.”64\nAlthough the most common, elektron was not the only Greek name for amber. It is likely that the substance referred to as lyngourion (there are other variants of the spelling—liggourion, for example) was a form of amber. Its derivation and its relationship to amber (elektron) were much discussed in antiquity and continue to be debated today. The earliest evidence for lyngourion is in Theophrastus\u0026rsquo;s late-fourth-century B.C. lapidary, where he notes similarities between lyngourion and elektron but does not consider them the same material.65 He seems to have had direct knowledge of some amber, which was dug up in Liguria and which he apparently considered a nonorganic substance. Theophrastus\u0026rsquo;s lyngourion is as hard as amber, which he includes among stones possessing a power of attraction, and possesses the same powers of magnetism, but, according to him, it has a different origin: it is the hardened urine of wild lynxes, which “is discovered only when experienced searchers dig it up” (figure 20).66 This origin story is doubtless the result of a fanciful attempt to explain the etymology of the word (lyngourion = lynx urine), a story that would have been additionally convincing because of the substance\u0026rsquo;s color.\n Lynx urine hardens into a stone.

Parchment, H: 21 cm (8 \u0026frac14; in.), W: 13.5 cm (5 3/10 in.). Courtesy of The Royal Library of Denmark.    It was probably another attempt at etymology that persuaded Strabo that excessive quantities of amber could be found in Liguria.67 Strabo makes no distinction between lyngourion and elektron, using the terms interchangeably. Pliny the Elder is as unimpressed with Strabo\u0026rsquo;s talk of Liguria as he is with the lynx-urine story. Pliny lists a variety of sources containing variations on one or both of these themes, but his final word on lyngourion is that “the whole story is false, and no gemstone bearing this name has been known in our time.” Although Pliny may have been justified in his skepticism (Liguria was no more a producer of amber than the lynx was of gemstones), lyngourion appears to be a term applied to highly transparent varieties of amber, while elektron was used more generally. Gemstones of lyngourion are first attested in third-century inventories of the Asklepieion on the south slope of the Acropolis and in the shrines of Artemis and the Eileithyia (goddesses associated with childbirth, light, and the moon) at Delos.68\nSeveral other terms for amber occur in Pliny the Elder\u0026rsquo;s treatise: he cites Philemon as referring to a white, waxen form of amber from Scythia as electrum, and a tawny variety (from another part of Scythia) as sualiternicum. Pliny also attributes to his contemporary Xenocrates of Aphrodisias the claim that sucinum and thium are the Italian words for amber, and sacrium the Scythian word. Nicias, Pliny tells us, says that the Egyptians called amber sacal (perhaps meaning simply “rock”), and that the Syrian word was harpax (because of its magnetic qualities; the Greek harpax means “a thief” or “one who snatches”).69 Pliny also singles out Callistratus as the first to distinguish chryselectrum, or “gold amber.”70 Dioscorides, in his first-century Materia Medica, describes two types of amber: elektron chrysophoron (golden amber) and elektron pteruyophoron (“because it draws feathers to it”); and he uses the word aigeiros, which means “poplar,” as a synonym for amber.71 The poplar is associated not only with Herakles (the hero brought back poplar branches from the underworld), but also with the tale of Phaethon—the most prevalent myth about the origin of amber (see below). Some authors, such as Pliny, use more than one term for the material, depending on the context.\nNotes The word elektron was also used in antiquity to describe the alloy of silver and gold (modern electrum). Both the fossil resin and the alloy are found in the Shaft Graves at Mycenae, but the earliest surviving source to discuss both materials is Herodotus.

Naturally occurring alloys likely were used alongside manmade ones. The electrum alloy is much harder than either gold or silver. Pliny (Natural History 33.23.80) says, “All gold contains silver in various proportions.… Whenever the proportion is one-fifth, the ore is called electrum.” J. Ogden, “Metals,” in Nicholson and Shaw 2000, pp. 162–64, discusses the makeup of gold alloys in Egypt over time and the range of color in surviving objects made from gold-silver alloys. Traditionally, an alloy with more than 75 percent gold present is described as gold. If it is a gold-silver alloy with less than 75 percent gold, it is electrum, and, according to Gale and Stos-Gale's more recent nomenclature (Z. Stos-Gale and N. H. Gale, “Sources of Galena, Lead and Silver in Predynastic Egypt,” Revue d'Archéométrie 3, suppl. [1981]: 285–96), “gold-silver alloys with 5–50 percent gold should be termed aurian silver (those with less than 5 percent gold are simply termed silver with low gold).” They go on to state: “The traditional division between electrum and gold at 75 percent gold level falls most inconveniently at just about the median composition for much Egyptian gold-work. Also the variable copper presence will have a major effect on colour” (ibid.). Compare Citation: Evely 2000Evely, R. D. G. Minoan Crafts: Tools and Techniques. 2 vols. Gothenburg, 2000., p. 401: “Electrum is a light-coloured alloy, though the precise percentage of silver required to constitute it varies according to authorities: as low as 8–10% or over 20% or even over 40%.… The commonest natural impurity of any degree is silver: anything up to 50% being called gold, thereafter the alloy is seen as basically a silver. It is largely a matter of semantics how such mixtures are termed, there being no hard and fast definition.… Pure gold probably never occurs naturally … it is rare to find 98–99% purity.” See also J.

London, 1992., n. 2, sums up: “The shining appearance which associated precious metals with the celestial bodies was a quality which may well have been seen as symbolic in other areas such as the high polish given to some stone statues and the varnish given to wooden objects.”\nTjehnet, an Egyptian word meaning “dazzling”—that which is brilliant or scintillating such as the light of the sun, moon, and stars, glistening with a light symbolic of life, birth, and immortality—was employed as an epithet of brilliance and bestowed on many gods including Hathor, Thoth, and Horus, whose light-filled appearances were likened to celestial light (extracted from Friedman and R. S. Bianchi in Citation: Friedman 1998Friedman, F. D., ed. Gifts of the Nile: Ancient Egyptian Faience. Exh. cat. Providence, RI, 1998., pp. 15, 28–29. Tjehnet applies to precious metals and faïence or, more correctly, glazed composition. It was not a cheap substitute material for precious and semiprecious stones but was valued in itself for amulets of the living as well as the dead. The light-filled material could promote the deceased's rebirth and help to impart life. Hathor is named in Late Period and Ptolemaic texts as Tjehnet, the Scintillating One. In Italy, from the Bronze Age onward, faïence beads and pendants are often joined with amber in necklaces and other kinds of adornment for (ultimately) funerary objects. Faïence may have had a similar meaning in both Italy and Egypt, and the interest in it may have arisen from its Egyptian origin and its authenticity, as well as from the transformed nature of the material and its color. Strings of glistening materials—amber, glass, faïence, and gemstones such as carnelian—all shared the divine qualities associated with luster; they were all manifestations of brilliance and were divine.\nA number of miniature kouros-amulets of glazed composition, found at Rhodes and now in the Louvre, are very close in form to the amber kouros in the British Museum (BM 41): Citation: Strong 1966Strong, D.

In the inventory of the Artemision at Delos, a lyngourion set in gold (a ring) is first listed for the years 278/69. At the Delian shrine of Eileithyia, a lyngourion set in a gold ring is first recorded in the inventory of 269. A connection of lyngourion (whether amber or not) with Aesclepius, Artemis, and Eileithyia may be owed to its sanative properties. As noted in the text, Artemis and Eileithyia are both associated with childbirth, the protection of the young, and the moon. Aesclepius's connection to childbirth and healing is established by his own birth. According to Pindar (Pythian 3), he was rescued from his dead mother's womb while she was being cremated on her funeral pyre.\nThe stone's bright color may have been another reason for its association with Artemis.

The name Zeus has associations of luminosity (it is derived from a word that means “to shine”), as do many of the common epithets for Greek deities: Phoebus Apollo means “radiant Apollo,” and the goddess Athena is often described in Homer as glaukopis, which can be translated as “with gleaming eyes.” Apollo appears to his worshippers at Delphi in a blaze of flame and brilliant light in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo. Similarly, the great heroes of ancient Greece often are depicted with a bright glow about them—like Achilles in the Iliad, “shining in all his armor like the sun.”72\nIn Quintus Smyrnaeus\u0026rsquo;s fourth-century A.D. Fall of Troy, the mourners at Ajax\u0026rsquo;s funeral lay “gleaming gold” and “lucent amber-drops” around his body.73 This connection between the radiance of precious jewels and the brilliance of heroes and gods was established in Greece as early as Homer. Given the strong associations among the dazzling, the divine, and the heroic, the choice of amber for a piece of jewelry or a work of art indicated a divine or heroic subject. For example, Pausanias mentions in his Description of Greece74 the amber statue of the emperor Augustus. The image must have been a “marvel to behold.”\nWhen amber was considered in terms of its hue (instead of its brilliance), the images it evoked were no less striking. The most sought-after pieces ranged from yellow to red—colors that were associated with fire and the precious metal gold (figure 21).75 The fiery and glowing colors were important to life, marriage, and death and were linked with divine forces. Yellow and red were redolent of fire (and consequently the sun) and of light itself, and were symbolic of life and regeneration.76 In the Roman writings of Martial and Juvenal, gold was often referred to as being red.77 And since Homer, amber and gold had been paired, and both were symbols of the sun.\n Hove tumulus cup, Wessex culture, Bronze Age.

Amber, D: 8.9 cm (3 \u0026frac12; in.). Brighton \u0026amp; Hove, Royal Pavilion \u0026amp; Museums    The various images that a gemstone\u0026rsquo;s color conjured up could sometimes, as in the case of elektron, determine its name. As we noted, etymologically the word is probably connected with elektor, “the beaming sun,” the root meaning being “brilliant.” Pliny the Elder, for instance, talks about a variety of jasper that was called boria (meaning “northern”) “because it is like the sky on an autumn morning.”78 And when Pliny discusses the different colors of amber, his terminology is almost invariably metaphorical. “The pale kind,” he writes, “has the finest scent, but, like the waxy kind, it has no value. The tawny is more valuable and still more so if it is transparent, but the color must not be too fiery; not a fiery glare, but a mere suggestion of it, that is what we admire in amber. The most highly approved specimens are the ‘Falernian,’ so called because they recall the color of the wine; they are transparent and glow gently, so as to have, moreover, the agreeably mellow tint of honey that has been reduced by boiling.”79\nThe metaphorical resonance of the colors associated with amber, like the divine and heroic associations of its brilliance, would doubtless have played an instrumental role in the kinds of subjects carved in amber and in its use. In ancient gemstones, a correspondence between color and subject was desired. According to an ancient epigram, the sea nereid Galene was cut into an Indian beryl because the stone\u0026rsquo;s blue color was appropriate for this personification of the calm sea.80\nAmber\u0026rsquo;s fragrance—it is the only “stone” that is both shining and fragrant—is enhanced through rubbing.81 Amber is thus a perfect material for a divine image, especially when we recall that “statues were regularly polished with perfumed oils, perhaps matching the emanation of fragrance that forms so regular a part of divine ephiphanies.”82 Not only the fragrance, but also the great age of the material, its mysterious origins, its transmuted nature, and its electromagnetic, optical, and other properties, as well as its divine and heroic epithets, would have evoked a variety of ideas in its beholders—radiant Apollo, the fiery sun, Olympian honey, Falernian wine.\nNotes Iliad 19.398 (R. Lattimore, trans., The Iliad of Homer [Chicago, 1961]). It is a common tendency in Greek poetry to emphasize qualities such as brightness or sheen rather than hue, as C.

Attempts to answer this question, from the early Greek poets to Late Antique authors, were made in a wide variety of disciplines—philosophy, poetry, history, natural science, and even pharmacology. But the most important, and the most varied, answers came from perspectives that were scientific (amber comes from tree sap or lake mud or the sea), geographical (amber comes from the northern ocean, Liguria, or Ethiopia), or mythological (it comes from the tears of Phaethon or of Meleager\u0026rsquo;s sisters). However diverse the various origin stories, they explain amber as either being related to the sun or the planets, or as being “of water” or “of earth.” These different beliefs about amber\u0026rsquo;s origin appear to have affected the very ways it was used.\nPliny\u0026rsquo;s chapters on amber in his encyclopedic Natural History are the most extensive surviving ancient source. Compiling his work at a time when amber was beginning to flood into Rome, he provides a survey of the stories then in circulation about the formation of amber, its geographical and mythical origins, and the way it was classified and used. The depth and complexity of the information available to Pliny is striking. Evidently there was a varied and lively debate about what amber was and where it came from by the time he was writing, right down to the question of whether it was a vegetable, mineral, or faunal product. Throughout Book 37, Pliny comments critically on his source material, contrasting its validity with current evidence. He passes over accounts that range from the theory that amber was moisture from the sun\u0026rsquo;s rays to the hypothesis that it was produced by heated lake mud before offering his own scientific conclusion: amber is formed from the sap of a species of pine, and, hardened either by frost, heat, or the sea, it “is washed up on the shores of the mainland, being swept along so easily that it seems to hover in the water without settling on the sea bed.”\nIn many of these accounts (including Pliny\u0026rsquo;s own), the sea and rivers play an important role in the manufacture of amber. This is probably due in part to the preponderance of amber found washed up onshore, and the idea may have been fortified by a belief, prevalent in early northern solar cults, that the sun (another commonly recurring theme in amber-origin theories) passes through the waters of the earth on its nocturnal path. And then as now, sea-origin amber is often encrusted with shells (figure 22).\n Baltic amber encrusted with barnacles. L: 8.6 cm (3 3/8 in.).   fullscreen Figure 22    Baltic amber encrusted with barnacles. L: 8.6 cm (3 3/8 in.). Photo: D. Grimaldi/American Museum of Natural History     But where, geographically, did amber come from? Pliny\u0026rsquo;s sources do not agree. Italy, Scythia, Numidia, Ethiopia, Syria, and “the lands beyond India” are among the suggestions. Pliny himself prefers those accounts that place amber\u0026rsquo;s origins in northern Europe: “It is well established,” he writes, “that amber is a product of islands in the Northern Ocean.” Herodotus was less sure: “I do not believe that there is a river called by foreigners Eridanus issuing into the northern sea, whence our amber is said to come, nor have I any knowledge of Tin-islands … this only we know, that our tin and amber come from the most distant parts.”83\nThe Eridanus River to which Herodotus refers was originally a mythical river that came to be associated with the Po and sometimes with the Rhône, among other locations. In the ancient sources, the Eridanus migrates about the map. Pliny\u0026rsquo;s comment on his sources\u0026rsquo; confusion about its location is typically pointed: “Such statements only make it easier to pardon their ignorance of amber when their ignorance of geography is so great.” The most likely explanation of this confusion is that the Eridanus at some point became connected in myth to memories of an early land–riverine amber route running from the Baltic to northern Italy.\nHerodotus himself affirms the existence of an exchange route running from the far north all the way to the Aegean. In his discussion of the Hyperboreans (a legendary race from the far north who worshipped Apollo), he mentions “offerings wrapt in wheat straw” that they bring to Scythia and that are passed from nation to nation until they reach Delos (Apollo\u0026rsquo;s birthplace).84 You cannot reach Hyberborea by either land or sea, says Pindar (Pythian 10.29); most stories of travel to and from this region involve flight. There is something otherworldly as well as northerly about the Hyperboreans\u0026rsquo; land.85 Scholars are undecided as to whether the offerings Herodotus mentions were actually amber, but it is likely that amber was transported on such a route.\nFurthermore, Apollonius of Rhodes (whose answer to the question “Where does amber come from?” is a mythological one) provides a link between amber and the cult of Apollo in his Argonautica. He refers to a Celtic myth that drops of amber were tears shed by Apollo for the death of his son Asclepius when he visited the Hyperboreans.86 That amber should come to be associated with Apollo is not surprising, given its connections with the sun, but it is significant that the connection should occur specifically in the context of the mourning of Asclepius. Amber\u0026rsquo;s role in mourning, evidenced by its funerary use, is constantly emphasized in mythology. There is an explicit connection between this mythology and the funerary use of amber in Quintus\u0026rsquo;s Fall of Troy. At the lavish funerals of Achilles and Ajax, the mourners heaped drops of amber on the bodies. For Achilles,\n Wailing captive women brought uncounted fabrics From storage chests and threw them upon the pyre Heaping gold and amber with them. For Ajax, Lucent amber-drops they laid thereon Tears, say they, which the Daughters of the sun, The Lord of Omens, shed for Phaethon slain, When by Eridanus\u0026rsquo; flood they mourned for him. These for undying honour to his son, The God made amber, precious in men\u0026rsquo;s eyes. Even this the Argives on the broad-based pyre Cast freely, honouring the mighty dead. 87\n By Quintus\u0026rsquo;s time, the tale of Phaethon88 had long been the preeminent myth associated with amber.89 The name Phaethon, meaning “the shining one” or “radiant one,” derives from the Greek verb phaethô. “to shine.” The Phaethon story, which provides a classic example of hubris followed by nemesis, was first recorded by Hesiod, and dramatized in Euripides\u0026rsquo; mid-fifth-century Phaethon. but it might be best known today from Ovid\u0026rsquo;s version in the Metamorphoses.90\nAccording to Ovid, Phaethon was the son of Clymene and the sun-god Helios. As an adolescent, he doubted his parentage and voyaged to the East to question his father. There the god welcomed his son and promised as proof of his paternity to grant any boon Phaethon might ask. The youth rashly demanded permission to drive the sun chariot through the sky for one day. So unsuccessful and dangerous was the young charioteer that Zeus was forced to kill Phaethon with a thunderbolt to save the world from destruction. The result was a disastrous cosmic fire. The youth\u0026rsquo;s flaming body fell into the legendary Eridanus River. His sisters, called the Heliades (daughters of Helios), stood on the riverbanks weeping ceaselessly for their brother until finally they were changed into poplars (figure 23). Thereafter the tears of the Heliades fell as drops of precious amber onto the sandy banks, to be washed into the river and eventually borne off on the waters to one day “adorn young wives in Rome.” Phaethon\u0026rsquo;s friend Cygnus, the king of Liguria, was so distressed that he left his people to mourn among the poplars and was eventually transformed himself, into a swan.\n Fall of Phaeton, engraving by Thomas de Leu after a painting by Antoine Caron.   fullscreen Figure 23    Fall of Phaeton, engraving by Thomas de Leu after a painting by Antoine Caron. From Les images ou tables de platte peinture des deux Philostrates sophists grecs, et Les statue de Callistrate (Paris, 1615), p. 90. Courtesy of the National Gallery of Art Library, A. W. Mellon New Century Fund     As in the Celtic myth about Apollo mourning Asclepius, Phaethon\u0026rsquo;s tale is one of a young life tragically cut short. When Diodorus Siculus tells the Phaethon story in his Library of History, he ends by pointing out that amber “is commonly used in connection with the mourning attending the death of the young.”91 But as well as reminding us of amber\u0026rsquo;s role in mourning, the poplars dropping tears into the river are evidence that there were theories connecting amber to tree resin as early as the fifth century (which marks the first extant occurrence of the Phaethon myth). The link between resin drops and tears is a natural one; myrrh, for instance, is explained in myth as the tears of Myrrha, who was changed into a tree for her crimes—indeed, the Greek word for tear, dakruon, can also mean sap or gum.\nA broader trend in mythology (in many cultures besides the Greco-Roman) connects precious stones generally to tears, and mythological accounts of amber\u0026rsquo;s origin do not always involve trees. Pliny refers to a (now lost) play by Sophocles that links amber to Meleager, the famous hero of the Calydonian boar hunt.92 According to one version of the myth, Meleager\u0026rsquo;s sisters, who were changed into birds (meleagrides, perhaps guinea fowl) by Artemis when he died, migrate yearly from Greece to the lands beyond India and weep tears of amber for their brother. Artemis\u0026rsquo;s role is a critical one in this story, considering the number of amber carvings that might be associated with her. While one Late Antique author places the Meleagrides on the island of Leros, opposite Miletus, Strabo sets the transformed birds at the mouth of the Po or south of Istria—locations of great interest considering the number of seventh-century ambers in the form of birds excavated from sanctuaries and graves in both Greece and Italy.\nAnother amber-origin story, recounted by Pseudo-Aristotle in On Marvellous Things Heard, offers an intriguing hint of connections among amber, sun myths, and metalworking, and of the presence of figured amber and Greek artists at the mouth of the Po.93 Ever-present in these accounts is the sadness of a youth\u0026rsquo;s early death, and this version involves Icarus, who was burned by flying too close to the sun. According to Pseudo-Aristotle, Icarus\u0026rsquo;s father, the master craftsman Daidalos, visited the Elektrides (“amber islands”), which were formed by the silting-up of the Eridanus River in the gulf of the Adriatic. There he came upon the hot, fetid lake where Phaethon fell, and where the black poplars on its banks oozed amber that the natives collected for trade with the Greeks. During his stay on these islands, Daidalos erected two statues, one of tin and one of bronze, in the likeness of himself and of his lost son.\nThere are recurring themes in all these myths: the death of divine or heroic youths, the mourning of the young, the sun (which was responsible for Icarus\u0026rsquo;s death as well as Phaethon\u0026rsquo;s), and the sea. Many Greek and early Roman stories about amber place its origin in the far north, and it is likely that the earliest myths incorporated knowledge of the northern solar cults and the medicinal and magical properties of amber.\nNot only was amber connected to the sun, it also came to be immortalized in the stars. It was characteristic of all precious stones in antiquity to have a planetary or celestial association, and by the third century at least, the Eridanus was thought to have been transformed into a constellation, the eponymic Eridanus, or River. Late Antique sources recount how Phaethon became the constellation Auriga, the Heliades became the Hyades, and the Ligurian king became the Swan.94 In Late Antiquity, Claudian described the river god Eridanus in a manner no doubt long imagined: “On his dripping forehead gleamed the golden horns that cast their brilliance along the banks … and amber dripped from his hair.”95 Why, as Frederick Ahl asks, is the Swan a friend of the sun\u0026rsquo;s child? The answer to this question explains in part why amber was important in ancient Italy, and why the long-necked birds are represented early and often in the “solar” material. The swan was a cult bird in northern Europe during the height of Celtic power, in the Urnfield and Hallstatt phases of European prehistory. “The evidence strongly suggests that this bird was especially associated with the solar cults that were widespread in Europe, and that can be traced from the Bronze Age, into the Iron Age.”96\nThe constellation of Eridanus “wets the clear southern skin in its tortuous course and with starry stream flows beneath Orion\u0026rsquo;s dread sword”: so writes Claudian in his panegyric of A.D. 404. Here, too, amber\u0026rsquo;s place in Greek myths suggests that it was viewed as an ancient material, something belonging to a great age of the distant past. But it also had a practical life outside of myth—by Pliny\u0026rsquo;s time, amber was very common in Rome, and a great number of amber objects were used as jewelry, incense, pharmaceuticals, and furnishings for the dead. Nonetheless, amber\u0026rsquo;s mythological significance would have had a powerful effect on the way the material was seen and employed in everyday life.\nOf course, as soon as one begins to delve deeper into the relationship between the myths and reality of amber, it becomes difficult to distinguish which is which. Myths about amber\u0026rsquo;s role in the mourning of the dead and the actual funerary use of amber, for instance, both have a direct correlation to the fact that amber can sometimes act as a tomb itself.\nThe connection among amber, tombs, and funerary customs is brought out in a unique Etruscan amber, the bow of a fibula, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the so-called Morgan Amber, possibly the most beautiful of all surviving pre-Roman carved amber objects (figure 24).97 The bow is carved into a complex grouping: a draped and shod female wearing a pointed hat holds the base of a small vase in her right hand and touches it with her left. A young, beardless man, with flowing hair, long garment, and bare feet, supports himself on his left arm. Nestled between them is a long-necked bird, presumably a swan. At the foot of the couch is an attendant. The amber apparently depicts a ceremonial banquet, but is the couple mortal or divine? Are the figures Aphrodite and Adonis (Etruscan: Turan and Atunis) and the bird, the goddess\u0026rsquo;s swan? Or is this an elite couple? If so, is the swan a symbol or a part of the event? The iconography of the reclining couple and the ceremonial banquet had spread earlier from the Ancient Near East to Greece and Etruria. Significant Archaic Etruscan sculpted and painted depictions are extant. If this were a funerary object and the subjects divine, rich mythological implications are possible. If the subjects are mortal, the pin could have functioned in some manner as a “substitution” for the deceased.\n Bow of a Fibula (safety pin) with Reclining Figures, Attendant, and Bird, Etruscan, ca. 500 B.C.

None of these monuments were made to be seen.… Was the deceased, through his material image, believed to be living in the funerary chamber, which has become a house, or in the trench where offerings of food were set out for him? 98\n Certainly, inclusions in amber—life visibly preserved for eternity—would not have been ignored when preparing amber for funerary purposes.\nThe insects and flora in amber, which Aristotle, and later Pliny and Tacitus,99 point to as proof of amber\u0026rsquo;s origin as earth-born, as tree resin, are apt metaphors for entombment and for the ultimate functions of the funeral ritual: to honor the deceased with precious gifts and to make permanent the memory of their lives. Three of Martial\u0026rsquo;s epigrams are devoted to this correlation:\n Shut in Phaethon\u0026rsquo;s drop, a bee both hides and shines, so that she seems imprisoned in her own nectar. She has a worthy reward for all her sufferings. One might believe that she herself willed so to die. As an ant was wandering in Phaethonic shade, a drop of amber enfolded the tiny creature. So that she was despised but lately, while life remained, and now has been made precious by her death. While a viper crawled along the weeping branches of the Heliads, a drop of amber flowed onto the creature in its path. As it marveled to \u0026gt; find itself stuck fast in the viscous fluid, it stiffened, bound of a sudden by congealed ice. Be not proud Cleopatra, of your royal sepulchre, if a viper lies in a nobler tomb. 100\n It is very unlikely that a swift, small snake could be entombed in such a fashion, but it is also only fair to allow Martial a degree of poetic license, given Cleopatra\u0026rsquo;s traditional association with the asp. A more intriguing possibility remains, however: that Martial was describing something he had actually seen or heard about—an early instance of amber forgery.101\nNotes Herodotus, Histories 3.115.↩ Herodotus, Histories 4.32–36; see J.

Practically speaking, such a piece would have fetched a much higher price than an unprovenanced or poorer-grade one. Then, as now, the impetus for forgery or false provenances would have been commensurate with price. Roger Moorey, addressing the issue of forgery in relation to blue-colored stones in the ancient Near East, writes that “the desire for rare coloured stones was so great that it stimulated the development of artificial gemstones, made first, before about 2000 B.C., of glazed dull stones or of faïence and increasingly thereafter of glass.”102 It is likely that various tree resins (particularly copal, a hard resin much younger than amber) might have been taken for amber—at least at the time of purchase—either through deliberate deception or because of a genuine misunderstanding.\nOf course, because some materials used to imitate amber also possessed, to some degree, the qualities for which amber was prized, they may have been valued in their own right, and it is therefore usually impossible to distinguish cases of successful deception from resins that were never intended as impostors. Tutankhamen\u0026rsquo;s tomb, for instance, was found to contain various nonamber resin objects.103 Were they forgeries intended to be seen as amber or another high-value resin, or were these materials equally valued for their own sake?\nEvidence of other amber-related forgeries in antiquity can be found in Pliny, who discusses the use of amber itself to approximate transparent gemstones, notably amethyst. Pliny also describes a technique for softening amber (a necessary step in clarifying it, and one preliminary to amalgamating small pieces of amber into larger ones, as is still done today). Although there is no extant ancient example of such an amber object, it is a compelling explanation for certain larger works referred to in ancient sources, such as the large drinking vessels mentioned by Juvenal and Apuleius,104 or the statue of Augustus at Olympia described by Pausanias. What we do have as examples of amalgamated amber pieces are segmented amber fibulae and a few carvings with added patches of amber, held together with glue or by adhesion with oil and heat. Fibulae sections were joined with reeds, sometimes covered in metal foil. Today, two pieces of amber may be united by coating their surfaces with linseed oil, heating them, and then pressing them together while still hot.\nProbably there was no need to conceal that such pieces were joined or amalgamated, as their craftsmanship was just as impressive as their size. That they were composed of pieces rather than carved from one large chunk of amber would have been generally known, since amalgamation techniques were common in Rome for other media, such as large ivory statues, wood marquetry, and glass. The greatest example of joined amber plaques is the famous Amber Room from Tsarskoje Selo, Russia, now reconstructed. “Compressed” or “mosaic” amber (as it is called today) is often darker and less lustrous than natural amber. Given the immense importance attached to amber\u0026rsquo;s natural sheen, artificial coloring applied to a high-value object might have been deceptive in much the same way as an inclusion forgery like Martial\u0026rsquo;s snake. Pliny was aware that good examples of pieces displaying amber\u0026rsquo;s unique qualities, such as inclusions or brilliance, were valued according to the secret knowledge they seemed to encompass as natural wonders, and he implies as much in his discussion of artificial coloring of amber.\nAdmittedly, we can only speculate about the exact nature and extent of amber forgery in and before Pliny\u0026rsquo;s time, but it was an early part of a continuing interest in making amberlike materials for scientific, manufacturing, and aesthetic (as well as more dubious) ends.105 In the early modern period, this interest is documented by no less a figure than Leonardo da Vinci, who describes one recipe for making fake amber from egg whites hardened by heating.106\nIn China, the high value placed on amber has resulted in counterfeiting since at least about A.D. 500, the date of Tao Hongjing\u0026rsquo;s book of materia medica. There he warns against false amber and recommends “using the electrostatic ability of amber to attract straw as a means of distinguishing amber from imitations.”107\nMore recently, significant modern forgeries of ancient amber objects have come to light. These include an “Assyrian” amber statuette of King Ashurnasirpal in Boston108 and the Apollo of Fiumicino (Paris, private collection), made in the early twentieth century, probably by the same carver responsible for the Getty statuette Seated Divinity (figure 25).109\n Seated Divinity Statuette, modern.

Today, an amber counterfeit such as the Seated Divinity is made with a mixture of modern materials including synthetic resin and plastics, as well as compressed amber and other resins. The interest today in amber forgery—in fake jewelry and fake specimens—is such that many modern publications and websites are available to help identify and distinguish amber, copal, and the wide range of manufactured-amber imitations.\nNotes P.

Rough pieces have been found in ancient dwelling caves in Britain and northern Europe at some distance from amber sources.110 Early on, amber likely was transported to the Mediterranean via a chain of exchange—there was no defined long-distance amber trade until the mid-second millennium B.C., when it probably was acquired in both raw and more finished forms.111 It is likely that amber traveled overland to the Mediterranean via the long route between north and south Europe, along the Oder, the Elbe, the Vistula, the Rhine, the Dniester, and other main European rivers.\nIt also traveled eastward. For a long period it, like tin, was carried by sea through the Gates of Hercules; Phoenicians were likely the main transporters. The Adriatic appears to have been the main destination for amber intended for the markets of the Italian peninsula.112 Once at the Adriatic, amber must have been moved by water along the Italian coast, finding its way inland along river valleys and mountain passes. It was likely traded from farther west and welcomed along with the Aegean and eastern Mediterranean goods that were transported to the central and western Mediterranean. The existence of raw and worked amber from sites around the Mediterranean and farther afield—on the Iberian peninsula, in Mesopotamia, Anatolia, at Ugarit on the Syrian coast, and in Egypt—from the Bronze Age onward attests to its widespread value and transmission. Trade in amber was likely a series of short-range transactions from the sources onward, with a few outstanding exceptions. We should imagine seekers traveling to the northern amber deposits to obtain the precious material and learn its secrets. The “knowledge” that accompanies a highly prized substance was as important as the thing itself.\nThere is no literary evidence for direct trade between Italy and the north until the first century A.D. Pliny the Elder writes of a Roman knight, commissioned to procure amber for a gladiatorial display presented by Nero, who traversed both the trade route and the coasts, bringing back an extraordinary amount of the precious material, which was used to extravagantly decorate the arena. Like the rare animals that were sometimes displayed at such events, amber nourished the idea of exotica from afar—visible affirmation of Rome\u0026rsquo;s domination of the world.113\nNotes Unworked pieces have been found in dwelling caves in Europe at the Grotte d'Aurensan in the Hautes-Pyrénées, at Judenes in Austria, at Kostelik and Zitmy in Moravia, at Cioclovina in Romania, and at Gough's cave near Cheddar, Somerset, England, all of which are far from natural sources of fossil resin. An upsurge in the quantity of amber in the archaeological record is observed in the Early Neolithic.

From there it was first brought into prominence by the Veneti, known to the Greeks as the Enetoi, who are close neighbors of the Pannonians and live around the Adriatic.”↩ J.

Certainly those uses that were by nature magical or tied up with mystery religions are unlikely to have been referred to other than obliquely in any mainstream literature, although they were extensive and widely acknowledged from very early on, through the Classical era and well into the Middle Ages. In addition, as helpful as the archaeological record is in elucidating the use of amber in mourning and burial contexts, it is less so when it comes to the everyday employment of amber as documented in the literature. Its use among the very wealthy ranged from girls\u0026rsquo; playthings, to decorative items such as the amber-encrusted goblet that Juvenal mentions in a satire, to sculpture such as the imposing statue of Augustus that Pausanias describes, to magical and religious purposes—amulets, incense, fumigation, and burnt offerings (which by definition do not leave any physical trace). Martial writes of the pleasant odor amber gives off when it is handled by girls, of “amber nuggets polished by hand,” and compares kisses to well-worn amber.114 In a letter to Marcus Aurelius, Fronto speaks scathingly of those writers (Seneca and Lucan) who “rub up one and the same thought oftener than girls their perfumed amber.”115 These analogies provide some explanation for the wear on many pre-Roman amber beads; magical use explains it further (figure 26).\n Female Head in Profile Pendant, Etruscan, 525–480 B.C.

Pliny (as usual) has a long list of possible uses: amber is carved into figurines (figure 27), 116 fashioned into truffle-cutting knives,117 made into artificial gems,118 and in Syria used for spindle whorls. He also describes amber drinking cups, arms, and decorations of the arena (uses that would have been appreciated by men as well as by women), although he prefaces these examples with denunciatory comments at the beginning of Book 37: “The next place among luxuries [after myrrhine and rock crystal], although as yet fancied only by women, is held by amber. All three enjoy the same prestige as precious stones … but not even luxury has yet succeeded in inventing a justification for using amber.”\n Lion with Bird Pendant, Etruscan, 600–550 B.C.

Amber is also often burned; as Tacitus says: “If you make an experiment of burning amber by the application of fire, it kindles, like a torch, emitting a fragrant flame, and in a little time, taking the tenacious nature of pitch or resin.”119 Pliny observes “amber chippings steeped in oil burn brighter and longer than the pith of flax.”120 This suggests that amber may have had a practical use as interior lighting. Pliny also cites evidence that the northern Guiones used amber instead of wood as fuel and refers to what must have been a very common use of amber as incense, suggesting that in India, “amber was, to its inhabitants, found to be more agreeable even than frankincense.”121\nSuch burning may seem a rather wasteful use of a precious material, but it was essential for offerings, for communication between the human and the divine, and even for feeding the gods, as in Egypt.122 As J. Todd has pointed out, “From the earliest recorded times burnt offerings and specifically incense are considered the most sacred gifts of all. The burning of amber would not have been considered a destructive act, but rather an elevated use of the material.”123\nAmber burned as incense was of great consequence in rituals involving solar deities before and during the Classical era, since both amber and incense were symbolic of the sun in the ancient world.124 Incense, which emitted a fragrant smoke when scattered on lighted coals (in either a stationary or a movable burner or censer), was a regular element in Babylonian religious ceremonies.125 The thousands of incense burners found in sanctuaries and graves throughout Greece and Etruria attest to the great importance of burning fragrant gums and spices. One of the oldest Etruscan tombs at Cerveteri, opened in the nineteenth century, was found to include “bits of amber and other oriental gums placed around the corpse,” as George Dennis recounts. A morsel carried off and later ignited by the excavator “caused so powerful an odour as to be insupportable.”126\n“Incense ‘offerings\u0026rsquo; were a normal part of sacrificial rituals and the use of incense was often called for in magical rituals.”127 In China, a nineteenth-century traveler records, chippings and amber dust left over from cutting figured pieces were used for varnish or incense. “The burning of the odiferous amber is the highest mark of respect possible to pay a stranger or distinguished guest, and the more they burn the more marked is their expression of esteem.”128\nIn ancient medical practice, incense, resins, wood shavings, and other odoriferous materials (usually plants) or aromatics were used as a form of fumigation, either alone or in compounds. It is also likely that amber incense was used in divination: omens were read in the plumes and short curls of smoke formed by burning amber (figure 28).129\n Piece of burning Baltic amber, producing its distinctive flame color and characteristic smoke.

Ewing     Amber incense may have been ground into a powder and mixed with other aromatics, or nitrates, to keep it burning. In Rome, as Karen Polinger Foster shows, incense was “shaped into cones, balls, discs, pyramids, obelisks, granules, and pellets as it had been in Egypt and the Near East.”130 But the Romans apparently did not follow the Egyptian practice of using figurative incense blocks in forms such as birds or recumbent calves, which clearly suggests a religious element to the burning of incense.131 A few pieces of unworked amber found in Etruscan graves might be construed as evidence of amber used for fumigation or as unburnt incense.132 And it may be that the very same amber objects considered then and now as ornament and amulet (for example, birds or recumbent calves) might also have been valued for their potential as light energy or incense.\nNotes Martial, Epigrams 5.37.11.

Amber's combustibility (and its corresponding application of being burnt) is suggested by at least two of its ancient names: sualiternicum and thium. Thium is derived from the old Italic thyem, or thyon. Ritters, cited by F. Eckstein and J. H. Waszink, was the first to connect thium with incense. Still today, amber is an important ingredient of incense in India and many other places in the world and is advertised globally, as a Web search can demonstrate.\nOn the ancient use of resins in incense, see Citation: Langenheim 2003Langenheim, J.

Ambrosini, Thymiateria etruschi in bronzo: di età tardo classica, alto e medio ellenistica (Rome, 2002), concentrate on frankincense and myrrh as incense ingredients. C.

Zaccagnino, “L'incenso e gli incensieri nel mondo greco,” in Profumi d'Arabia: Atti del Convegno, ed. A. Avanzini (Rome, 1997), pp. 100–20, offer a fuller discussion of incense, but no mention is made of amber. However, other ancient authors do describe additional substances burned as incense, as Mueller says. See Aristotle (Meteorology 4.10), where he lists in one breath “amber, myrrh, frankincense, and all the substances called ‘tears,’” and Theophrastus, On Odours 12–13, where he differentiates among myrrh, frankincense, and “anything that is burnt as incense.” G. Banti, “Names of Aromata in Semitic and Cushitic Languages,” in Citation: Avanzini 1997Avanzini, A., ed. Profumi d\u0026rsquo;Arabia: Atti del Convegno. Rome, 1997., p. 169, underlines the difficulty in “singling out the gum resins of frankincense and myrrh with respect to other aromata … particularly in the most ancient literary sources and in the reports by the earliest European travellers.” Burnt amber has a delicious odor. From all of the evidence in the ancient sources, archaeological evidence, and the widespread use of amber in incense throughout the world today, it is hard to believe that amber was not used as incense (or an ingredient thereof), in fumigation, and/or in sacrifice.↩\n Citation: Black and Green 1992Black, J., and A.

To be overly concerned with the distinction among the roles of amber (sacral, ornamental, magical, medicinal) is perhaps to miss the more subtle relationships among them. Pliny makes no such mistake: “Even today,” he writes, “the peasant women of Transpadane Gaul wear pieces of amber as necklaces, chiefly as adornment, but also because of its medicinal properties. Amber, indeed, is supposed to be a prophylactic against tonsillitis and other affections of the pharynx, for the water near the Alps has properties that harm the human throat in various ways.”133 “Amber is found to have some use in pharmacy,” Pliny goes on to say, “although it is not for this reason that women like it. It is of benefit to babies when it is attached to them as an amulet.”134 In this passage, we find one of the two surviving ancient literary references to an amulet of amber, a use (the archaeological evidence tells us) that was pervasive from as early as the mid-second millennium B.C. Caesarius of Arles gives us the other: he warns his readers against wearing “diabolical” amulets made of certain herbs, or of amber, around the neck.135\nWhat did these amulets look like? The ones that Pliny refers to may have been perforated and polished raw lumps; or perhaps they were bulla-shaped or crescent-shaped.136 It is possible that they were made into special shapes, including figural subjects, as had been traditional for amber amulets in northern Europe and around the Mediterranean (and beyond) for millennia. Might one of Pliny\u0026rsquo;s amulets be similar to the Roman Head of Medusa (see figure 1)? Or might they have been like one of numerous surviving small carvings in amber—bird and animal figures, or corn ears and fruit—given as New Year\u0026rsquo;s presents in imperial Rome? Several of these New Year\u0026rsquo;s gifts bear inscriptions referring to this occasion, evidence that amber\u0026rsquo;s magical properties were still significant.137\nThe act of writing on or figuring a material—providing it with a face or a form—gave it new significance and power.138 One might write on a gemstone or amulet “to create the impression of mysterious power by virtue of the writing itself.”139 Now, in addition to the associations the material itself carries with it, the figured object has become a metonym for a past event, or a desired outcome, or perhaps for the attributes of a deity (see the rams\u0026rsquo;-head figures 29 and 39). Such an object derives new significance when it is attached to a person—tied around the neck, perhaps, or fastened to the arm or a girdle. Unsurprisingly, the Greek terms for amulet, periamma and periapta, come from a verb that means “to tie on,” and an amulet worn by a human can be defined, quite simply, as a powerful object attached to a person.140 Ancient amulets range widely in type, from natural objects141 to simple carved pendants to figured objects to lamellae, objects inscribed with magical symbols or incantations to ward off evil. The material from which the amulet was made was critical. T. G. H. James suggests, “Although certain materials, semiprecious stones in particular, were invested with magical properties in ancient Egypt, it seems that these properties were usually only activated when the stone in question was used for the manufacture of amuletic figures of specific kinds.”142\n Ram’s Head Pendant, Italic, 500–400 B.C.

Almost any jewelry object could have had some apotropaic function—and, as Geraldine Pinch remarks in her book on Egyptian magic, it is hardly an exaggeration to say that most Egyptian jewelry has amuletic value. How conscious wearers were of their ornaments\u0026rsquo; symbolism is a more difficult question to answer.143\nThe same is evidently true for amber objects of adornment. In life, amulets were worn as charms to bring good luck, health, protection, or love, to avert danger, or to cure disease. Figured or inscribed amulets often would have had a sympathetic function;144 a figure of a boar, such as the Getty plaque Addorsed Lions\u0026rsquo; Heads with Boar in Relief (figure 30), might have brought luck in a hunt, safeguarded the wearer from the boar he was hunting, or even may have channeled the powers of Herakles or Meleager. Situations of potential crisis, such as a hunt, a dangerous journey, or childbirth, warranted temporary amulets.145 More permanent amulets, in the form of jewelry, could have provided protection during childhood, throughout an individual\u0026rsquo;s life, and during the fraught voyage to the afterworld, the dangerous realm of spirits and demons. Indeed, amber and amber amulets were important elements in the mourning ritual as permanent tears and as grave gifts.146\n Addorsed Lions’ Heads with Boar in Relief Plaque, Etruscan, 500–480 B.C.

The impact of the Aegean, the Near East, and Egypt (where women and children wore the majority of amulets) on native Italian customs during the first millennium B.C., a period of contact and acculturation, is evidenced by the amulets\u0026rsquo; subjects. New images, spells, amulets, deities, and aspects of deities replaced, perfected, or married with the old. Although only a portion of the extant figured ambers can be associated with religious cults, the use of amulets was certainly bound up with secret knowledge of sources of power—the province of skilled practitioners such as magicians, priests, “wise women,” healers, and midwives.147 Practitioners of magic might exert an influence on all levels of society. Theophrastus maintains that Pericles, on his sickbed, was induced by the women of his household to wear an amulet—entirely against his better judgment. The story, whether apocryphal or not, is further evidence for widespread use of amulets among the elite, as well as the lower classes.148 It is also interesting for its indications about the role of women in promoting such use.149\nAmulets were especially valuable to women for controlling or increasing fertility, protecting the unborn, helping to ensure safe childbirth, and safeguarding their children. Protective gynecological amulets must have been among the earliest of all amulets. Such practices in Italy and the Greek world were age-old, the lore passing from generation to generation, no doubt affected by contact with new populations, practitioners, and magical practices.\nOne seventh-century plain pendant in the Getty collection (figure 31) is inscribed with two images, on one side a fish and on the other something resembling the Egyptian symbol of a papyrus clump, or a pool with lotus flowers. This piece is one of forty-three beads from the same parure, its original findspot now unknown. Who scratched the signs? How were they understood? Was the mere presence of Egyptian, or Egyptianlike, writing enough to make the amber more efficacious?\n Pendant inscribed with two Egyptianizing hieroglyphs, 7th century B.C.

The serious dangers of disease for young children and the considerable risks for women in childbirth and early motherhood gave rise to a belief that the dead were jealous of new life, and the need for magical protection of women and children was a compelling one.150 For a pregnant woman, amber\u0026rsquo;s property of encapsulating living things may have made it an especially powerful similia similibus amulet, a “pregnant stone.”151 Resin also heals damage and wounds in trees; could it extend such properties to people wearing it?\nThe bulla, a lens- or bubble-shaped container, is perhaps the best known of all ancient amulet types. Known in Rome as Etruscum aurum, it combined two magical functions: it enclosed amuletic substances and it symbolized the sun in material, in form, and in its powers.152 The shape derives from age-old disk amulets of the sun. The bulla was given to high-born boys. The ancient sources relate that the king Tarquinius Priscus was the first to present his son with a gold amulet after the son had killed an enemy in battle, and from that time onward the sons of cavalrymen wore amulets. Ancient sculpture shows that Etruscan boys wore the bulla, and Roman writers recount that it was worn by magistrates, triumphant generals, and even domestic animals. It should be noted that bullae were made not only of gold, but also of other bright metals such as bronze, as is evidenced by bronze bullae of various forms found in Latin and Etruscan graves, dating as early as the eighth century B.C.\nIn fourth-century pre-Roman art, the single bulla and strings of bullae, not only lens-shaped but also pouch-shaped pendants, were worn by elite personages, some recognizable divinities and heroes. Dionysos wears a single bulla on the Praenestine “Cista Napoleon” in the Louvre.153 On an Etruscan red-figure krater in Florence, an Argonaut wears strings of bullae on his arms, while a companion ties on yet another (figure 32).154 On a sarcophagus from the Tomb of the Triclinium at Tarquinia, a reclining woman wearing a necklace of bullae, holding a thyrsus and kantharos and keeping a fawn by her side, is clearly a devotee or maybe a priestess of Dionysos/Pacha/Fufluns. On Etruscan mirrors, Aplu, Fufluns, Tinia, Epiur and Maris, young Hercle, Thetis and Alcumene, Athena, and Turan wear bullae.155 Votive images of women, girls, and boys, and effigies of deceased men, women, and babies, are often shown with a bulla or bullae.156 A mid-fourth-century mirror in New York shows Peleus wearing an armlet with bulla-shaped pendants on her left arm and Calaina (Galene), a Nereid, holding a circlet with similar pendants in her left hand (figure 33).157\n Red-figure crater attributed to the Argonaut Group, Etruscan, early 4th century B.C.

Bullae of amber were special translations of the form: they were sun-shaped and sun-colored, shining like the sun, and instead of containing amuletic substances inside a metal envelope, the material itself was a curative (remedia) that could enclose inclusions.\n Necklace, Italic, 550–400 B.C.

If amber was fiery and glowing, its most prized characteristics, then this alone might have ensured it a special protective and sanctifying role.159 Amber could also symbolize constancy. Amber necklaces were gifts for brides, mortal and immortal, as the ancient sources tell us.\nAnother sympathetic function of amber amulets might have been their ability to focus the powers of a particular deity and astrological force. Amber\u0026rsquo;s magnetic properties gave it a special role in attraction (and displacement), and because of its already potent associations with the sun, amber may have been thought able to draw, attract, and fix the sun\u0026rsquo;s influence.160 Ancient beliefs in the ability of stones to draw down the power of the planets and stars, and especially the rays of the sun, were widespread and are described first in Egyptian texts and later in Hermetic writings on talismans. We might extrapolate from such sources how amber might have worked in this regard. One Hermetic papyrus describes how “the magician draws down to earth the spiritual powers of the star, planets, and fixes them in talismans prepared of the proper substances and engraved with or shaped into the proper symbolic forms.”161 In early modern Europe, amber, gold, and rubies—all solar materials—were believed, like the sun, to have the property of generating the vital spirit of the microcosmos.\nIt is not difficult to see how a shiny amber amulet could have been thought to contain sunlight or to allow light to pass through it in some active sense. In Greece and Italy, songs, healing words, spoken prayers, and incantations accompanied such amulets. Roy Kotansky traces the use of written incantations and symbols with amulets back to the rituals of Egypt and the Near East and notes that these “may have been transmitted to Ancient Greece and Italy by traditional folk means, traders, or itinerant medicine men or women.”162\nThere is a relative paucity of information in Greek and Latin literature about amulets and their use, as noted above, and much of the archaeological evidence awaits study. However, what does exist is enlightening, as recent scholarship shows. Some well-known examples indicate how pervasive was the use of “tied-on” substances: Pericles, sick with the plague, was prodded into wearing an amulet around his neck. Socrates in Plato\u0026rsquo;s Republic lists amulets and incantations as among the techniques used to heal the sick.163 More is known about Egyptian and Near Eastern amulets, from both written sources and archaeological evidence. Such information may be useful in coming to conclusions about early Greek and Italian use of amulets, but despite the similarities, it would be a mistake to assume that all such usage had Oriental prototypes. Much less is documented about northern European practice, and yet many subjects of the figured amber pendants found in Italy have Baltic precedents that are thousands of years older: standing human figures (figure 35), faces, and detached heads, bears, and hoofed animals.164\n Female Holding a Child (Kourotrophos), Etruscan, 600-550 B.C.

From the point of view of amber amulet usage in Italy, seven large ambers, four of which are figured—two female heads and two satyrs—found in Tomb 48 at Ripacandida are of great interest.165 Angelo Bottini has suggested that the objects were not part of a necklace but may have been put inside a pouch or strung together to form a chaplet or a sort of rosary.166 A chaplet, or circlet, with bulla-shaped pendants held by the figure of Calaina (Galene) on a fourth-century Etruscan mirror (figure 33) is an unusual ornament in Classical art. In Assyrian and neo-Assyrian art, a goddess carries a similar chaplet, or so-called string of beads, as an attribute.167 Amuletic pouches, containing all sorts of materials and objects, remained popular throughout Italy until the modern era. At the end of the nineteenth century, Giuseppe Bellucci collected and studied hundreds of such protective bags, or sacchettini, many of great age.168\nUsing terms such as necklace, armlet, collar, pectoral, or girdle for worked amber objects minimizes their ties to older amuletic traditions. There is a long history of such strings of amulets (some are seals) throughout Europe, in the Mediterranean littoral, and in the Near East. Such groupings are documented as early as the Early Dynastic period (third millennium) at Ur.169 Mesopotamian texts specifically refer to figured amulets in the context of protection and healing, amulets that were to be either carried and worn by the living or placed on various parts of the deceased\u0026rsquo;s body. Strings of amulets are documented as hanging in houses in the ancient Near East. In Greek, Cypriot, and Etruscan art, babies and children (and some Greek young women) are depicted wearing amulets tied onto a long cord worn diagonally across the body. This tradition may well be the ancestor of the Roman crepundia. As Demetrius Waarsenburg argues, the crepundia (charms strung together and used as rattles for children) can be connected to these assemblages of amulets, implying that they originally had a more profound significance.170\nAlthough nearly all figured amber pendants excavated in Italy were found in funerary contexts, many of them had “lives” and an owner or owners (not necessarily the deceased) before they became part of the mourning ritual. Interments could contain both old and new pieces. Some may have been heirlooms, already venerable and powerful, made so by provenance, status, or accrued potency.\nSome beads and pendants show signs of use—of handling, of pulling on the suspension perforations, of rubbing. Was the rubbing done to enliven the electromagnetic properties of the amber? To release its fragrance? For the tactile sensation? To activate amber\u0026rsquo;s divine associations? For medicinal and magical purposes? To enact the magic of the amulet\u0026rsquo;s imagery?\nThe blurred features of some figured ambers must be due to handling in the course of amuletic use. Several examples from controlled excavations seem to confirm this. A female head from a grave at Latronico retains sharp groovings in the hair and crisp delineations in the diadem, but has smoothed facial features (its tiny chips are likely from modern times). It has a standard perforation through the top of the pendant but also a secondary perforation through the temple area, front to back, which has been elongated by gravity and pull, very like the holes on heirloom Tibetan or African amber beads. The Herakles and satyrs\u0026rsquo; heads from a woman\u0026rsquo;s grave, Tomb 106 at Braida di Vaglio, which may be at least a generation older than the burial, are salient examples of nonuniform use wear. The face of the Herakles pendant is especially worn.171 Some figured ambers from another of the Braida di Vaglio tombs, Tomb 102, that of a little girl, are clearly worn on the prominent surfaces of the face. The features of one of the frontal female faces is nearly worn off, and three of the rams\u0026rsquo; heads, as well as the pendant in the form of a dormant feline, show evidence of use wear. This is in contrast to the comparatively fresh surface of other ambers from the tomb, including the recumbent sphinx (which is also at least a generation older than the burial).\nThe woman\u0026rsquo;s Tomb 48 at Melfi-Pisciolo included at least five figured pendants, but only one female head in profile shows considerable surface wear. It contrasts with the male subject, a crisply detailed winged nude youth in a Phrygian hat with a shield at his side and sword in his hand.172 A large pendant of Eos carrying off a youth, perhaps Kephalos, from a burial of circa 350 B.C. at Tricarico-Serra del Cedro, is an extreme example of face-rubbing: the youth\u0026rsquo;s face is nearly lost.173 Female heads from a documented find at Valle Pega (Spina), and rams\u0026rsquo; heads from excavated tombs at Bologna, show well the contrast between the better-preserved tops of heads and the more abraded faces.174 A number of the Getty female and rams\u0026rsquo; heads illustrate similar patterns of wear. Many other carved amber objects from burials throughout Italy (and Serbia) bear signs of wear: pulling troughs at the suspension hole, as in a head of a satyr from Palestrina (figure 36), handled or rubbed surfaces, and repairs, such as the drilling of replacement perforations or securing broken pieces in mounts.175\n Dancing Figure or Head of Satyr, Etruscan or Italic, early 5th century B.C.

Why and when were they bored? Raw amber pieces are sometimes found with large round holes in their center, the result of resin forming around a branch or twig (now disintegrated). If a piece of amber was purposely perforated before it was made into an object, the act might have occurred anywhere between the Baltic and Italy, and at any time, for it is likely that amber moved south in both worked and unworked form from earliest times. On a practical level, the holes may have been drilled into the amber to better protect it when it was suspended from a pin; or, once the piece was cored, it would have been suitable for wearing on a pin. The smoothed prominent surfaces of the Getty pendant Winged Female Head in Profile (figure 37), the multiple throughbores, the abrasion troughs in the suspension perforations at the top, and the central hole all indicate that this pendant must have been used over a period of time before it was finally interred in a grave.176 How, and by whom, amber pendants were used during life is a subject for speculation. Pliny\u0026rsquo;s account is one useful source of information, and the few surviving Archaic and Classical illustrations of people (and divinities) wearing figured elements and amulets around their necks and limbs are valuable evidence for figured pendant usage outside of the grave context.\n Winged Female Head in Profile, Etruscan, 525-480 B.C.

Paintings or sculptures of figures wearing a string with a single amulet or a group of them (as opposed to necklaces designed with repeating elements) are uncommon in Archaic and Classical art from Italy, but the depictions that do survive depict bullae-wearing men, women, and children, horses, and even ravens. Human figures of both sexes were them around the neck and on the upper arms. The single ornaments include gorgon masks and the heads of animals, such as fawns, lions, and rams. A number of terracottas of seated goddesses from Greek sanctuaries in Magna Graecia, for example, wear strings of figured elements, among them bulls\u0026rsquo; heads.177 On Greek vases, on Cypriot terracotta sculptures of temple boys, and on Laconian bronze images of partly clothed young women are seen cross-torso carriers bearing various kinds of amulets: crescents, boar tusks, circlets, and other shapes. Women wearing a single lotus-blossom pendant are represented in terracottas, bronzes, and plastic vases of the late sixth and fifth centuries. Pomegranates and simple flowers are also not unusual.\nAll amulet wearers depicted on Etruscan fourth-century mirrors are elite subjects, and most are identified as divinities and heroes. Two examples are important for amber pendants, especially because of the material\u0026rsquo;s association with Apollo/Aplu and Dionysos/Fufluns. On many Etruscan fourth-century mirrors, Aplu wears pendants around his neck or on his upper arm. On an Etruscan mid-fourth-century bronze mirror, the infant Dionysos/Fufluns is already adorned with a ribbon of amulets during his birth from Tinia\u0026rsquo;s thigh. Fufluns as a youth, now with a necklace of amulets but otherwise unadorned, is kissed by his mother, Semele, on another.178\nKey illustrations of animal pendants in use are painted in the Tarquinian Tomb of Hunting and Fishing (circa 510 B.C.) (figure 38).179 On the back wall of the main chamber, the male banqueter wears a necklace of three (possibly amber) rams\u0026rsquo; heads almost identical to the Getty amber rams\u0026rsquo; heads (figure 39). In the first room of the tomb (figure 40), simple carriers with rams\u0026rsquo;- and lions\u0026rsquo;-head pendants, similar to those in the Getty (figure 41), hang from branches. This room of the tomb may depict the grove of Apollo or a Dionysian setting.\n Reclining Couple with an Attendant, back wall of the Tomb of Hunting and Fishing, Tarquinia, Etruscan, ca. 510 B.C.

Thus, the magical rite included the actions that accompanied the words, while the objects or ingredients used in the rite were equally important; see Citation: Pinch 1994Pinch, G. Magic in Ancient Egypt. Austin, TX, 1994., p. 76. The stone's role actively implemented the communication between suppliant and superior; see Citation: Winter 1999Winter, I. J. “The Aesthetic Value of Lapis Lazuli in Mesopotamia.” In Cornaline et pierres précieuses: La Méditerranée, de l\u0026rsquo;Antiquité à l\u0026rsquo;Islam: Actes du colloque organisé au Musée du Louvre les 24–25 novembre 1995, edited by A. Caubet, pp. 45–68. Paris, 1999., p. 40. In a similar vein, Gordon 2002 (n. 7), p. 83, confirms: “The spells in the magical papyri generally contain two elements, the preparation of materia magica and an accompanying incantation, whose function is either to activate the inherent properties of the material, or to invoke a named divinity and his or her metamorphs. Although the balance between these elements is variable, we may call this the tacit or implicit model of good practice, a model whose appropriateness was learned by practitioners in the course of their training.” J. Borghouts, Ancient Egyptian Magical Texts (Leiden, 1978), p. ix, emphasizes that “spells are the verbalized core matter of the rite.”↩\n Many objects excavated from Italian tombs (of as early as the eighth century) are generally considered amulets. These include flints, fossilized shark teeth, shells of various species, bears' claws and teeth, boars' tusks, faïence figures of Bes, and “Phoenician” glass masks. Many are commonly described as jewelry or by an equivalent word, but rarely as amulets.↩ T. G. H. James, “Ancient Egyptian Seals,” in Citation: Collon 1997Collon, D., ed. 7000 Years of Seals.

For the ancients familiar with the Phaethon or Meleager myths, the tears may have called up the weeping of the Heliades or the Meleagrides. Amber objects are found on the body, unassociated in the tomb, on top of cremated ashes, and, in rare cases, outside the container within the grave complex. H. Horsnaes, The Cultural Development in North-Western Lucania, c. 600–273 B.C. (Rome, 2002), p. 85, reminds us that “personal ‘gifts' and ritual objects may have had plural functions (indeed one object would often belong to more than one of these categories): the practical function in the rituals taking place during the burial, the display of wealth/status for the community attending the burial, or the needs of the deceased in his/her afterlife.”↩ Citation: Dickie 2001Dickie, M.

Bellucci, Il feticismo primitivo in Italia, e le sue forme di adattamento, 2nd ed. (Perugia, 1919), show the long duration of charms and amulets in Italy. Many uterine amulets are for quieting the womb, while others are to still or retain a “wandering womb.”↩ Magical stones, which protect pregnant women, are listed in most ancient lapidaries. See n. 68. ↩ Juvenal (Satires 5.163–65) calls the bulla the Etruscum aurum, and some Roman writers (Pliny, Natural History 33.4; Festus, De Significatione Verborum 26.25; Plutarch, Vita Romulus 25) refer to the bulla as a specifically Etruscan ornament. The importance of the bulla for high-born Etruscan boys is evidenced by the third-century bronze statuettes “Putto Carrara” and “Putto Graziani” in the Museo Etrusco Gregoriano: Citation: Cagianelli and Sannibale 1999Cagianelli, C., and M. Sannibale. Bronzi a figura umana. Museo Gregoriano Etrusco Cataloghi 5. Vatican City, 1999., pp. 110–34, nos. 2–3.\nP. G. Warden, “Bullae, Roman Custom, and Italic Tradition,” Opuscula Romana 14, no. 6 (1983): 69–75, outlines the amuletic custom of the bulla, drawing attention to one from Campovalano that contains three small stones and to elaborate figured bullae displaying, for example, apotropaic devices, Bes, or the gorgoneion. J. Sebesta, “The Costume of the Roman Woman,” in Citation: Sebesta and Bonfante 1994Sebesta, J. L., and L. Bonfante, eds. The World of Roman Costume. Madison, WI, 1994., p. 47, notes the apotropaic nature of both the bulla and the band of the toga praetexta. Macrobius (1.6.8–14), discussing a bulla worn by a triumphant general, says it enclosed curatives (remedia) that were believed to be strong against invidia. Invidia is one of the words used to describe the dangers amulets were intended to prevent or act against. See M. Dickie, “The Fathers of the Church and the Evil Eye,” in Byzantine Magic, ed. H. Maguire (Washington, DC, 1995), pp. 9–27 (with essential bibl.), where Dickie shows that the term evil eye as such was hardly used in classical antiquity and the Christian world:\nThe terms most often used are, by Greek speakers [Gr. phthonos] and [Gr. baskania], and by speakers of Latin, invidia and fascinatio or fascinus. What men feared under these headings was not a single object with a secure and fixed identity but a complex of objects with shifting identities, and identities that coalesce.… The more or less constant factor in this constellation of fears was envy: men were afraid lest their good fortune would draw envy on their heads. The mighty fear it would come from their fellow men, demons, the gods, fortune, the fates, and a malign supernatural power they called simply [Gr. phthonos] or invidia. (p. 12) See also J. Russell, “The Archaeological Context of Magic in the Early Byzantine World,” in Maguire 1995 (see above), pp. 37–38. The same word (invidia) was used in nineteenth-century Italy for the same purposes, as revealed in Bellucci 1889 and Bellucci 1919 (n. 150, above).\nArchaeological evidence for Roman domestic animals with bullae is to be found in the bronze bullae-ornamented horse tack buried at Populonia: Warden 1983 (above in this note), p. 70, with reference to A. Minto, Populonia (Florence, 1943), pp. 185–86, pl. 49.5. R. D. De Puma called my attention to the many bulla-wearing animals in Etruscan art, including the terracotta horses from the Temple of the Queen's Altar, Tarquinia, and the ravens on Etruscan mirrors. Exempla of human bulla-wearers are on the stone sarcophagus from the Tomb of the Sarcophagi, Banditaccia Cemetery, Cerveteri (Museo Gregoriano Etrusco in the Vatican). Round bullae are worn by the deceased male on the lid and by a woman and both horses on the box front: B. Nogara, Guide du Musée de sculpture du Vatican I: Musée et Galeries Pontificaux (Vatican City, 1933), p. 412; and R. Herbig, Die jüngeretruskischen Steinssarkophage: Die antiken Sarkophagenreliefs (Berlin, 1952), p. 46, no. 83, pls. 1–2.\nA. Coen, “Bulle aurée dal Piceno nel Museo Archeologico Nazionale delle Marche,” Prospettiva 89–90 (1998): 94, has best articulated the difference between the wearing of multiple bullae by various personages and the single bulla by boys. The bulla was offered up to the Lares at puberty on the day of Liberalia, thus connecting the boy to Liber and the sphere of Dionysian activity. Coen hypothesizes that the gold bulla buried with high-status individuals, women particularly, connote a particular status and were worn in view of the “religious salvation” and heroization of the subjects represented on the bulla. Coen notes that bullae are frequently found in graves with corona aureum, perhaps also Dionysian. Figured gold bullae (dating as early as the sixth century, but mainly of the fourth) usually are worn in multiples; they include obvious Dionysian subjects as well as other age-old aversion devices, the gorgoneion being a notable example. If the bulla-wearing Dionysos on the Praenestine “Cista Napoleon” is also Liber, the image may be a link to the tradition of boys dedicating their bullae to Liber at puberty. See [^156], below.\nA subject still deserving closer study is the relationship between the large figured amber pendants (found mainly along the Adriatic and in the Basilicata) and the pictorial gold bullae and pectorals of the fifth and fourth centuries (found mainly in Etruria, Latium, and Picenum). Both are made from materials with solar connotations and figured with apotropaic, heroic, and divine subjects, especially ones associated with rebirth and most particularly with Dionysos.\nIn addition to the bibliography above, see Citation: Bonfante 2003Bonfante, L.

The large, lens-shaped amber has a relief gorgoneion in its center and seven feline and human heads carved around its edge. The drilled holes on its periphery could have been used to attach additional small pendants.\nAn Egyptian text describes how a solar amulet such as a bulla or an amber (or both) might work: “The hand and seal of the sun god are the mother's protection. Each morning and evening, she recites the magic spells over an amulet that she hangs around her child's neck. She prays to the rising sun. She implores him to take away the dead who would like to steal her child. She does not give her child to the thief from the kingdom of the dead”: Borghouts 1978 (see 140, above).↩\n G.

Unfortunately, many of the known amber bulla-shaped pendants are without secure provenance. The largest amber bulla known to me comes from the Belmonte Piceno Tomb 94, a grave typed as female by I. Dall'Osso (cited by Citation: Rocco 1999Rocco, G. Avori e ossi dal Piceno. Rome, 1999., p. 107, n. 473). It was found in a woman's tomb with iron armor and arms, parts of a cart, bronze torques, bracelets, fibulae of various kinds (including ones with amber segments and one with bronze bullae pendants), and other amber objects.

As well as its use for amulets and adornment, it was employed to embellish arms and musical instruments, to create spindles, buttons, and pins, and to decorate boxes and furniture. Carved amber and amber-embellished objects were offered to deities and buried in sanctuary foundation deposits. In the Greek-speaking world and in Italy, these deities were almost exclusively female ones, especially those associated with childbirth. Amber was also significant in funerary contexts. Large amounts of it were buried in the Shaft Graves at Mycenae. Four of the graves in Circle A, which included both females and males, contained numerous beads: the most prolific was Grave IV, with nearly thirteen hundred. The beads “may have been imported ready-made, since [they] are different from the mass of Aegean ones.”180 The head and chest of the woman buried in Grave Omicron of Circle B were covered with various precious materials, including over a hundred amber beads and spacers.181\nThe resources required to obtain so much amber must have been enormous. At this stage, certainly, amber was a material for the social elite, although as time went on, it became more widely used. As Helen Hughes-Brock observed:\n The large necklaces and spacer plates were only for the very few and very rich, and hardly found their way beyond the great centers of the northeastern and southwestern Peloponnese. However, generation by generation amber spread over the Mycenaean world and to Crete and down the social scale. 182\n The Late Mycenaean amber finds are in tombs of every type, and very occasionally in shrines—although no solid evidence connects them to any particular group of people, deity, or cult. In the ancient Near East, Mesopotamia, the eastern Mediterranean, and Egypt, amber was a rare substance during the Bronze Age. A recently discovered small Baltic amber vessel in the form of a lion\u0026rsquo;s head was an exceptional objects placed in the main chamber of the Royal Tomb at late–Bronze Age Qatna, at Tell Mishrifeh, Syria (Damascus, National Museum MSH02G-i0759). It, like the other exotic, high-prestige objects found on the remains of a multiburial bier, may have served a ritual purpose. It is the most significant figured amber to come from an excavation in the region. Was it carved in the Syro-Levantine region, at Qatna even, or might it have been an exchange object or diplomatic gift?183\nAmber is attested with a high degree of probability in the New Kingdom, from the period of the 18th Dynasty (1550–1295 B.C.) onward, but only in exceptional circumstances and always in conjunction with other precious materials, such as rock crystal, gold, lapis lazuli, or faïence. Sinclair Hood argues that a number of “resin” objects from the tomb of Tutankhamen, including two heart (possibly) scarabs and the necklace, which he identifies as being from the Tumulus culture of central/northern Europe, are actually amber.184 The Tutankhamen amber would be a very early instance of funerary amber in Egypt, and an extremely early instance of an amber scarab, a form that became a popular subject in Orientalizing Italy (eighth–seventh century B.C.), especially in Etruria, given the scarab\u0026rsquo;s importance as a sun symbol and its concurrent connection to rebirth.185\nThe importance of amber in Bronze Age northern and central Europe is demonstrated by major finds and significant objects pointing to several regional centers of manufacture with local characteristics, as Aleksandar Palavestra and Vera Krstić summarize.186\nIn Italy, the Middle Bronze Age finds of amber in the Basilicata and Late Bronze Age finds at Frattesina, in the Po valley, are symptomatic of an active trade in both raw and finished products. The amber finds from Italy are early evidence of a long tradition of amber consumption among women of high social rank on the peninsula.187\nNotes S.

For the most part, it was at the end of the eighth and especially during the seventh centuries when amber was most popular in Greece and peninsular Italy. This is not to leave out a few extraordinary tenth-to-early-eighth-century exceptions, notably at sites in Italy, in Latium, at Castel di Decima, and, most recently, in the Roman Forum and in the Basilicata, in the area between the Agri and the Sinni, where, in the graves of elite women, remarkable amber parures were discovered. This is the case with a girdle with interspersed bird-shaped beads from the Enotrian Tomb 83 at Latronico.188 On the whole, amber-embellished objects were buried in both male and female graves, but figured amber is almost exclusively found in those of women and children.189\nCarved figured ambers of eighth-to-seventh-century date are characteristically small (on average, roughly fingertip size), suggesting that these works, mainly pendants, were carved from small pieces. None are composites, that is, works made from almost imperceptibly joined pieces, as is characteristic of contemporary fibulae from Etruria, Campania, and the mid-Adriatic. Among the earliest figured finds are those from the eighth-century necropolis at Veio Quattro Fontanili. They include a standing ithyphallic male, monkeys,190 a horse, a duck, and a human lower leg and foot, as well as both scarabs and scaraboids, some of which have intaglio horses engraved on their flat sides.191 All of these are amuletic subjects of great antiquity, and truly Orientalizing.192 A cinerary urn buried in the First Circle of the Interrupted Stones at Vetulonia (of circa 730–20 B.C.) contained a number of high-status objects, including an amber scarab, thus indicating an object interred after cremation.193 The scarab may well have been an import, like the accompanying glass beads and bronze Phoenician bowl, although the urn also contained locally produced objects. A number of female graves in and around Magna Graecia each contained but one small waterbird, which may be related to the Egyptian duck amulet, a symbol of regeneration; it may also be related to the duck symbol of northern Europe. Since the Bronze Age, the duck, a multivalent symbol both guardian and apotropaic, was believed to connect the chthonic and other worlds.194\nIn Greece, worked amber was buried in foundation and votive deposits as well as, more rarely, in graves. A pair of Geometric-date tombs (possibly of priestesses or princesses) at Eleusis offer critical evidence of amber in the burial of women of the highest rank.195 The rich tombs include sumptuous grave gifts, among them necklaces of gold, amber, and faïence, and amber-inlaid ivory furnishings. The presence of glowing elektron bears witness to the lavish and exceptional occasion of the entire funeral process.\nBoth figured and nonfigured ambers have been excavated at sanctuaries dedicated to a limited number of divinities, mainly female. These include objects from the sanctuaries of Artemis (Ephesus), Artemis Orthia (Sparta), Hera Limenaia (Perachora), and Apollo Daphnephoros (Etretria). Intaglios were found at Perachora, and two animals at Aetos (Ithaca). The earliest date to the decades around 700 B.C. and represent birds at rest and couchant animals, and they, like the contemporary Italian objects, are generally quite small. At Ephesus, the foundation deposit was buried circa 700 near the cellar of the temple of Artemis. Anton Bammer has suggested that the ambers (and accompanying ivory objects) are the remains of a pectoral worn by an early statue of the goddess.196 Other figured Greek works of this period include the by-now traditional subjects of figured amber: crouching monkeys, recumbent lions, human heads, and birds, ducks, and other species.197\nThe seventh-century B.C. ambers from Italy are almost exclusively mortuary and more extensive in number, type, and size than the contemporary Greek examples. As is characteristic of all art from the Orientalizing period, they take on a character different from the eighth-century material, although birds, especially ducks, retain their popular status, as they do in other figurative arts in Italy. At some sites, figured amber is found in combination with faïence amulets of Egyptian fertility and protective subjects.198 The primary seventh-century finds have come from Etruria, Campania, and Latium; Etruria Padana and elsewhere in the mid-Adriatic; and from the Basilicata. Recent discoveries in southern Italy and at the Adriatic site of Verucchio (near Rimini) have greatly modified the picture of amber importation and use. One rare figured subject from the extraordinary amber-rich graves at Verucchio is a fibula decoration of addorsed ducks.199\nFigured ambers excavated at southern Etruscan sites include the ubiquitous monkeys and a number of standing “nude” females, their arms in various poses associated with fertility.200 An exceptional example, dating to the first half of the seventh century, is the elaborate grouping of amber pendants and beads (possibly a collar) found on top of the cremation layer in a tomb at Vetulonia.201 Little else accompanied the strings of amber: the figured pendants include fish,202 a scaraboid, seven monkeys, and eleven standing female figures dressed only in collars and armlets, with legs apart, the vulva exposed, and hands placed on the lower abdomen. The most important pendant represents an enthroned female giving birth, the infant\u0026rsquo;s head appearing between her legs.203 This tiny amber is the strongest evidence to date for a direct link between amber and childbirth.\nMany other types of figured amber from the second half of the seventh century correspond to standard Egyptian amuletic iconography. Among the most popular are the dwarf deities, such as Bes and Pataikos-Ptah—the most common Egyptian protective genies.204 Bes was known to protect sleepers and women in childbirth and safeguarded the young mother and her children. Both figures have solar associations; the Pataikos-Ptah figure, part adult and part infant, symbolized the infant sun. Almost without exception, the images on early amber carvings were reiterations of Egyptian-sourced solar and rebirth symbols.\nThe main focus in this catalogue is amber in the form of figural subjects, but the many beads and pendants of this period in botanic or shell forms are also important, since they, too, served a similar role via a metonymic process. Amber cowrie pendants, common in Italy from the seventh to the fifth centuries B.C., were potent subjects of fertility and childbirth, since the mature cowrie shell was thought to resemble the vulva. The extraordinary Getty Cowrie Shell / Hare pendant (figure 42), for instance, combines two subjects: fertility and regeneration. Scarab-cowrie combinations, such as that represented by a ninth-century amber from Tursi (Basilicata), do the same. In Egypt, both real cowries and imitations in gold and other materials were strung together to make girdles and worn in the pelvic region.205\n a \u0026amp; b.

The most important surviving ensemble of the seventh century from Italy is that of a high-ranking woman buried at Latin Satricum (Tomb VI).206 The grave, dated circa 650/40 B.C., contained a flint (actually a Neolithic obsidian scraper),207 and more than five hundred amber objects—fibulae, spindles, nonfigured beads and pendants, and numerous figured objects. The medley of stylistic and iconographic connections of the objects is typical of the period and place, but the burial is without parallel: it is the largest single burial with amber from ancient Italy. The figured pieces include nude females and males (some doubled and addorsed), fantastic creatures,208 and fish, and some of the pendants were carved from large amber blanks. Some pendants are unique, others variants on or copies of Egyptian subjects: fish, Bes, and patakoi. The unworked pieces of amber, here and in other tombs, may also have served as fumigants, unburnt incense, or apotropaics.209 This grave\u0026rsquo;s goods and the many contemporary large amber fibulae of the mid-Adriatic of these decades speak to new sources (geographic or cultural) or to new access to big pieces of jewelry-grade amber.\nNotes S.

The exceptions are critical (such as the male Tomb 43 at Melfi-Pisciolo).↩ Orientalizing Greek and Etruscan images of nonhuman primates are generically referred to as “monkeys” in the literature, although some may represent baboons, especially the hamadryas baboon (Papio hamadryas), as well as a long-tailed monkey (Cercopithecus) and the green monkey, or vervet (Cercopithecus aethiops). The prototypes of the eighth-to-seventh-century amber pendants from Italy (Etruscan, Latin, Faliscan, Picene) are Egyptian in invention, but they also may have derived from Phoenician examples and could be related to northern Mesopotamian, northern and western Syria, Old Babylonian, and Anatolian types and symbolism. In Egypt, amulets in the form of monkeys and baboons are first known in the Old Kingdom. The earliest amulets are made of steatite and faïence; of amethyst and carnelian in the Middle Kingdom; and in a wider variety of materials from the New Kingdom onward. The green monkey is most often the subject of Egyptian and Phoenician simian amulets: its humanlike features, the females' motherly love, its cleverness and ability to mimic, and its greenish color (symbolic of freshness and regeneration) account for its popularity. It participates at the side of the dwarf as an emissary of Ra, the sun-god, in magical invocations for successful parturition and thus has a solar aspect Citation: Andrews 1994Andrews, C. Amulets of Ancient Egypt. Austin, TX, 1994., p. 66. In Egyptian glazed-composition faïence maternity amulets, where it is joined with Bes, the green monkey takes on the role of nurse for the newborn and is connected to music and the dance, as associated with birthing.

Monkey representations in the Levant seem to carry several connotations, of both Near Eastern and Egyptian origin, including veneration, eroticism, good luck, and best wishes. In erotic scenes on Old Babylonian terracottas, simian dancers often keep company with dwarfs. As S. Schroer and J. Eggler, “Monkey,” in Iconography of Deities and Demons in the Ancient Near East, www.religionswissenschaft.uzh.ch/idd (accessed November 12, 2009), p. 1, note for Mesopotamian and Elamite art: “Just like in Egypt, there is a proximity between the monkeys and the Nude Goddess. This may be due to their playful nature, but also their excitability … leading to their association with sex and eroticism.”\nAmber and glazed-composition amulets of monkeys might work in various direct and indirect forms of magic: to ensure love and sexual fulfillment; to provide sexual aid in this world and the next; to aid in rebirth and rejuvenation; to assist in the care of newborns; and to inject humor (a potent aversion technique).

Marinatos, “An Offering of Saffron to the Minoan Goddess of Nature: The Role of the Monkey and the Importance of Saffron,” in Gifts to the Gods: Proceedings of the Uppsala Symposium 1985 (Boreas 15), eds. T. Linders and G. Nordquist (Uppsala, 1987), pp. 123–32, who argues convincingly for a religious function for monkeys and interprets various Minoan roles for them: as adorants, as intermediaries between humans and the goddess of nature, as her servants, and as guardians. Marinatos draws parallels with Egyptian and Anatolian images of squatting monkeys (nn. 10, 17) and suggests the images' possible entry into Crete in the Middle Bronze Age, but points also to Mesopotamian examples of the squatting posture. Both Egyptian and Near Eastern prototypes are proposed, with reference to R. D. Barnet, “Monkey Business,” Journal of Near Eastern Studies 5 (1973): 1–10; and C. Mendelson, “More Monkey Business,” Anatolian Studies 33 (1983): 81–83. F.-W. von Hase 1984 (above) proposes Phoenicians as intermediaries in the transition of the motif to Italy. For a view on the possible permutation of the “monkey” type into human imagery in early Greece, see S. Langdon, “From Monkey to Man: The Evolution of a Geometric Sculptural Type,” [[AJA]] 94 (1990): 407–24.\nTo be added to this discussion are the simianlike “emaciated humans” of the Old Babylonian period, the clay plaques of the goddess Nintu, and the separate statuette images in the same form. D. Parayre, “Les âges de la vie dans le répertoire figuratif oriental,” KTEMA 22 (1997): 67, identifies the figures as representing premature or deformed fetuses. See her figs. 10a (stamped relief possibly from Tell Asmar, Louvre) and 10b (bronze statuette, Cincinnati Art Museum). Parayre suggests the fetus images may be figural transpositions of the šumma izbu series, listing the precautions to take in the case of premature, nonviable, or monstrous births. If the amber pendants represented such fetuses rather than monkeys or baboons, they would be extraordinary “like banishes like” amulets. Alternatively, if the amber monkeys are identified with the Minoan interpretation of the type (following Marinatos), they may be associated with the Cretan nature goddess, as in Mesopotamia.↩\n For Italian finds of eighth- and seventh-century date, Citation: Waarsenburg 1995Waarsenburg, D.

Also apt is his assessment of the term Phoenician: “We cannot simply call the orientalia (and Orientals) in question ‘Phoenician’ e basta.” The term encompasses considerable diversity; as coined by the Greeks, it was used to describe Bronze Age Canaanites, Iron Age Phoenicians, and Punic Carthaginians.

Although dwarf figures were associated with a number of gods, they were commonly linked with Bes, often called simply “the dwarf.” V. Dasen, “Pataikos,” Iconography of Deities and Demons: Electronic Pre-Publication: www.religionswissenshcaft.uzh.ch/idd (accessed September 9, 2006), p. 1, summarizes: “The term pataikos is first used by Herodotus (Historiae 3.37) to describe representations of the god Ptah in the form of a dwarf equated with Hephaistos,” and “It remains unclear whether they depict various forms of one and the same god, or a group of dwarf gods, as with Bes.” Connected with solar and rejuvenating symbolism, they were regarded as a solar hypostasis, embodying the morning form of the sun-god, newly born and old at the same time. “Their association with the continuing process of creation may have motivated their identification with Ptah in his capacity as a creator god and likewise with Horus, Khnosu, Osiris, and other youthful and regenerative gods.” In respect to protection, Pataikos-Ptah seems to have been concerned with both the living and the dead; it aimed to guard the family, especially pregnant women and small children, against unpredictable negative forces. As prescribed in magical spells, pataikoi could be worn around the neck as helpers during delivery. Pataikoi are often discovered in burials, where they had a strong afterlife symbolism; see Dasen, above (with refs.). For Bes, see esp. M.

J. The Northwest Necropolis of Satricum: An Iron Age Cemetery in Latium Vetus. Amsterdam, 1995., pp. 410–11, nn. 1058–64: The “flint” likely originated on the nearby island of Ponza and is thus one of several secondarily reused in the Iron Age. Obsidian “flints” are found in central Italy in tombs dating from the ninth to the seventh centuries and in several Latin votive deposits, including Satricum. A tomb from Terni yielded a Neolithic flint wrapped in an embossed bronze sheet medallion with a representation of Bes. Waarsenburg suggests that the “flint” from Tomb VI would have been known in antiquity as a ceraunium, or lightning stone. P. Tamburini, in Antichità dall'Umbria a New York, exh. cat. (Perugia, 1991), p. 276, discusses such lightning stones and cites A. Cherici, “Keraunia,” [[ArchCl]] 41 (1989): 372, n. 37. Tamburini points to the ancient belief “in the heavenly origin of prehistoric flintstones found by chance on the ground … of their relation to the thunderbolt” and “to their simple apotropaic function.” Still, in early-twentieth-century Italy, Neolithic flints are recorded as important amulets to protect against lightning, and to protect people, animals, houses, and land against natural disasters, as G. Bellucci (n. 150) shows. In Etruria, both Menerva and Tinia could hurl thunderbolts, and as such they may have had oracular faculties, as suggested by G.

It concerns the early Greek philosopher Thales of Miletos, the first to recognize amber\u0026rsquo;s magnetism, which he argued was proof of a soul or life, even in inanimate objects. Did he observe this property at home when watching women spinning Miletos\u0026rsquo;s famous wool with an amber spindle and distaff?\nAfter about 600 B.C., the record shows a change in amber use. Individual pieces and long strings of worked amber became much rarer throughout the Mediterranean, perhaps owing to relative scarcity or to fluctuations in trade or even its interruption (perhaps by the Celts). Thus, amber finds from the next decades take on a particular importance. Most are very small pieces used for inlay, in multimedia fibulae, in small ivory and bone boxes, or in furnishings. Three composite ivory or bone and amber figured objects dating to the first half of the sixth century are of considerable iconographic importance: a pair of plaques from the Picene territory, from Tomb 83, that of an elite woman, at Belmonte Piceno;210 and a pair from a late Hallstattian Celtic tomb of an elite woman at Asperg, Germany. The two Picene plaques each represent a winged female figure flanked by two smaller female figures. The winged female is represented in the schema of Potnia Theron (Mistress of the Animals) or perhaps another (now unknown) divinity of protection and fertility. The carving is on all sides; the faces (now lost) were inlays of amber. Giulia Rocco attributes the reliefs to Picenum, noting the Greco-Orientalizing character of the figures and their relationship to portrayals of Artemis in the Laconian world. The Halstattian furniture plaques with amber-faced sphinxes are generally believed to be Laconian.211\nThe figured ambers of the sixth to fourth centuries B.C. range in size from the tiny (20 mm) to the very large (250 mm) and are formed in a range of subjects, some traditional and some new to the material. They are mainly pendants and fibulae bow decorations. Not only is there a wide distribution of finds on the peninsula, but many of the individual pieces are of exceptional size. This is the third great flourishing of archaeologically evidenced amber importation in the Mediterranean-rim area before the time of the Flavian emperors.\nMost large sixth-to-fourth-century figured works demonstrate a new respect for the original shape of the raw material in its naturally occurring forms—rods, drops, or sheets—and figural subjects accommodate the ancient resin\u0026rsquo;s form. Italian figured ambers of the eighth and seventh centuries continue ancient traditions, but new kinds of amuletic figuration developed during the sixth century B.C. in response to changing local and contemporary magical, medicinal, and sacral needs. The multifarious seventh-century fertility and hunting divinities began to be replaced by Olympian subjects and hitherto unknown faunal and fabulous subjects. Rams, lions, and boars (figure 43) take the place of frogs, monkeys, dogs,212 and sphinxes. Sirens now proliferate, and dancers appear. Pendants in the form of detached heads, of either specific female divinities or other figures, are among the few traditional subjects that retain their important place right through to the beginning of the fourth century B.C. Yet despite the change in iconography, the categories of appropriate subjects do not appreciably change: they are still the protective and regenerative subjects of tradition, the subjects that could enhance or focus the powerful properties of amber.\n Foreparts of a Recumbent Boar Pendant, Etruscan, 525–480 B.C.

Los Angeles, The J. Paul Getty Museum, 76.AO.84. Gift of Gordon McLendon. See cat. no. 37.    A number of exceptional (unprovenanced) ambers can be dated to the sixth century based on their style and iconography. Among them are the Getty Divinity Holding Hares group (figure 44), the Getty Ship with Figures pendant (see figure 6), a two-figure group in London, Satyr and Maenad (see figure 17, which is perhaps instead a dancing male and female),213 and a group of four pendant figures, possibly from Ascoli Piceno, now in Philadelphia: two crouching nude males and an addorsed pair of draped female figures.214 A recumbent lion, found in a circa 560–50 B.C. tomb at Taranto, is a rare example of a piece from a Greek colonial city.215 These are “contemporary” works for their time, but they also evince artistic connections to older central Italic and Etruscan art, to the eastern Mediterranean, and to East Greek and Peloponnesian art. This wide range of influences might suggest simple explanations: itinerant carvers with a rich artistic vocabulary or a workshop in the ambient of a great crossroads. While both may be accurate, this line of thought underemphasizes the magical aspects of the imagery. Alongside such evocative and wide-ranging explanations should be considered the fact that the figured ambers were made as amulets, or objects following a “prototype” or recipe, or modeled according to tradition and prescription, which required the practitioner to absorb various symbol systems and modes of representation. There must have been persistent types, and a long-lived oral tradition behind them. Because precision of execution is essential to efficacy, “magical practices have little potential for modification, change, and interpretation and thus tend to be slower to change than most other aspects of culture.”216 What Jaś Elsner queries from the starting point of a large-scale offering at Delphi is relevant here:\n In what sense is an image identical with the deity or activity it represents? The magical and theological properties of images, as well as the way the offering of the Orneatai could actually substitute as a \u0026gt; ritual, hint at a much more dynamic interpenetration of image and referent, representation and prototype, than we usually allow for in discussions of mimesis.… Here … the context of the image asserts the actual presence of its prototype. 217\n  Divinity Holding Hares Pendant, Etruscan, 600–550 B.C.

Three burials, rich in amber objects that date to the end of the sixth century, demonstrate the tradition (extending back to the Bronze Age) of burying strings of ambers in elite females\u0026rsquo; tombs: at Sala Consilina, with three necklaces totaling a minimum of 114 pieces; in Tomb 102 at Braida di Vaglio, with nearly 300; and at the “princely” tombs at Novi Pazar (Serbia), with over 8,000 individual amber beads, pendants, and related objects. In the Braida di Vaglio tomb, the skeleton is that of a young girl.219\nFifth-century finds are more concentrated outside coastal sites in Latium, Etruria, and Magna Graecia. They are dispersed at the fringes of Etruria, the mid-Adriatic area, and in Campania and Basilicata. A very large number of surviving figured ambers, mainly pendants, can be dated by context or style to the period of about the mid-fifth to early fourth century B.C. They range in subject from the now-traditional rams\u0026rsquo; heads, female figures, detached heads and faces, and satyrs to whole animals and mythological creatures in repose to more innovative images. The new subjects reflect the plurality of cultural and commercial relations established among Greeks, Etruscans, and other indigenous peoples, and many show the incorporation of new ways of attracting the good, averting the dangerous, or picturing the voyage to the afterworld and its guides. New to amber, but already established by this date in vase and wall painting, bronzework, and gold, all of which have come from graves, are action figures: Dionysian revelers vintaging or dancing,220 a charioteer, a swaying Danaid, and figures in flight, sirens especially.221 Athena, with lionskin, shield, and lance, is in movement: the Pyrrhic dance?222 Aggressive subjects of rape, imminent or active combat, or triumph over death emerge: Eos and Kephalos (or Tithonos), Herakles killing the Nemean lion, Ajax, or Achilles lying in wait.223 Only in a few cases such as these can heroes and divinities be surely identified.\nThe style and iconography of the ambers of this period come out of the artistic traditions of Greece (including Magna Graecia), Etruria, and other Italic areas. Some heads have old-fashioned “divine” hairstyles and large, severe faces, conjuring up Near Eastern divinities. Most wear old-fashioned Etruscan dress, the significance of which deserves more attention. Generally speaking, the Archaic style has a secure hold throughout the fifth century B.C. and well into the fourth. Some works are very like other sculptural works and compare well with the corpora of ivories, bronzes, and terracottas. Others, significantly, are old-fashioned in style: many have the oversized eyes of much earlier art, kept alive in the millennia-old schemata of divine and heroic representations of the Near East; some are remarkably like Hittite sculptures. The huge eyes signify the figure\u0026rsquo;s identity and the characteristic keenness of sight of the supernatural. Wide-open and exaggerated, the eyes of the amber heads project a dazzling gaze, emphasizing the efficacy of their role as apotropaia, or devices of protection and danger-aversion (figure 47).224\n Female Head Pendant, Italic or Campanian, 500–480 B.C.

Nearly every subject represented in amber during this period has counterparts in other media found in Italy, namely sculpture, vases, and gems, as well as in Greek, Etruscan, and Italic architectural decoration. In some cases, individual objects or monuments have been related to ancestors, or clan, as well as to place, or cult.225\nRather than coming from Etruria proper, almost all fifth- to fourth-century B.C. ambers are documented as coming from (or are believed to have been found in) areas with significant Etruscan connections: at sites north of the Po; in Campania; on the Italian mid-Adriatic seacoast; farther inland in Basilicata, Lucania, and Calabria; at Aleria (Corsica); and at Kompolje (Croatia). As is true for the earlier figured ambers from nonpeninsular finds (Novi Pazar, most importantly), those from Aleria and Kompolje are closely related to Italian finds. Unfortunately, as is the case with the ambers from the eighth to sixth centuries, only a few ambers of fifth- to fourth-century dates have been included in the study or, in some cases, publication of the graves\u0026rsquo; skeletal material. None of the significant amber objects from chance finds, problematic excavations, and illicit undertakings are able to yield information about the sex of the inhabitant(s) and other critical contextual information. The admirable exceptions, including many recent excavations in the Basilicata, show that tombs with figured amber of the sixth to fourth centuries were female burials, with one anomaly: the man buried in Tomb 43 at Melfi-Pisciolo. All the others belonged to women and girls. Figured pendants, in almost every case, were found on the upper torso, once the elements of neck and chest adornments, or in the pelvic area, once girdle pendants.226\nMany of the (well-published) fifth-century B.C. tombs with figured ambers from southern Italy are critical evidence for amber\u0026rsquo;s importance to the inhabitants and to the funeral customs of elite women of the populations, which reveals the continuation of certain late Bronze Age (indigenous) traditions and the impact of Magna Graecian and Etruscan culture in the interior through interaction with more recent settlers of the Tyrrhenian and Ionian coasts. The link between amber and ritual, elite status and salvation, is undeniable. Two exemplary tombs of elite Italic females might be singled out: the aforementioned late-sixth-century Tomb 102 from Braida di Vaglio and the late-fifth- to early-fourth-century Tomb 955 from Lavello-Casino. Both contain not only significant pieces of figured amber, but also gold (a grape-cluster necklace in Tomb 955) and a selection of vessels and utensils for banqueting, mixing and drinking wine (Italic and Greek traditions are both represented), and roasting and eating meat.227 The contents reveal a climate welcoming the worship of Dionysos in Italy, and perhaps the impact of Orphism.\nDionysian subjects had come into prominence in figured amber by the sixth century, satyrs first and then other imagery, and some ambers probably were prepared expressly for funeral rituals. They are powerful evidence for the importance of the resurrection divinity in folk religion and cult in Italy.228 They, like the evidence of banquet practices and sacrifice in indigenous graves, denote an afterlife condition of beatitude, and the mysteries of Dionysos constituted one path to salvation.229 Amber could have illuminated the way.\nDionysos (figure 48) watched over Italy, as we hear from the chorus in Sophocles\u0026rsquo; Antigone: “God of many names … you who watch over far-famed Italy.”230 Dionysos, the god not only of wine but of dance and drama, who promised experiences outside the corporeal (ecstacies), was an obvious focus for individuals worried about the afterworld.231 By the fifth century B.C., as Susan Guettel Cole has observed, “the rituals of his cult were clearly associated with themes of life and death. Dionysos was a god whose myths about a double birth, death, and rebirth, and a journey to the underworld made him a figure attractive to those who wished to find a way to escape the anxieties of death.”232\n Head from the statue of the Young Bacchus (Dionysos), Roman, A.D. 1–50.

Dionysos also knew the great sea, into which he plunged to avoid Lycurgus and from which he was rescued by Thetis, and where he showed his powers as he transformed his Tyrrhenian pirate captors into dolphins. The liquid, winelike optical characteristics of amber may have created a natural connection between Dionysos and the ancient resin. As E. R. Dodds writes in his edition of Euripides\u0026rsquo; Bacchae, “[Dionysos\u0026rsquo;s] domain is, in Plutarch\u0026rsquo;s words, the whole of hugra phusis [the principle of moisture], not only the liquid fire of the grape, but the sap thrusting in a young tree, the blood pounding in the veins of a young animal, all the mysterious and uncontrollable tides that ebb and flow in the life of nature.”233]\nSatyrs (figure 49), nymphs, Bacchic revelers, heads of the god, and other Dionysian subjects are among the most numerous of the fifth-century funerary figured ambers. And Dionysian subjects would be the most common of Roman-period figured ambers.234\n Satyr Head in Profile Pendant, Etruscan, 525–480 B.C.

Herakles (figure 50) in Greece and Italy (in Etruscan, Hercle) was another powerful apotropaic figure because of his cultic roles as danger-averter, healer, and death-dealer.235 His polyvalent cult functions in Etruria and much of the Italian peninsula were also associated with trade, triumph, transhumance, and initiation; and he was worshipped in his oracular and mantic roles.236 The hero-god is represented in amber derived from various schemata—Greek, Etruscan, and Cypriot. Two amber amulets of the Cypriot-type of Herakles show him wearing a lionskin helmet: these pendants were doubly potent, for the lionskin itself was a standard protective device.\n Votive statue of Hercle, Etruscan, 320–280 B.C.

Los Angeles, The J. Paul Getty Museum, 96.AB.36.    The Homeric heroes Achilles and Ajax, both represented in amber, also had longstanding danger-averting, protective, and propitious roles in Greek and Greek-influenced culture. Achilles triumphed in arms (Achillean sharp-subject amulets “cut” pain). An amulet with Ajax, heroic rescuer of the fallen body of Achilles, who committed suicide by falling on his sword but was said to live after death on the island of Leuke, might also “cut” pain or offer protection.\nMost importantly, Homer\u0026rsquo;s very words were magical. Quotations from his work could heal people when whispered in their ears or written on amulets, preferably of gold, hung around their necks. Not only could Homer cure disease; he could also make fruit trees grow and favor people\u0026rsquo;s relations with one another.237\nHeroic and martial figures could play important roles in what is called aggressive magic.238 Subject, material, and actions (such as attachment and incantation) were likely combined in the use of potent objects for healing. The large amber pendant of Herakles stabbing the Nemean lion (with blood spurting from the wound) in the Bibliothèque nationale de France might be explicated by the recipe of physician Alexander of Tralles (circa A.D. 525–circa A.D. 605) for abdominal pain, or colic. It was to be given if a patient “would not follow a regimen or could not endure drugs.” It reads: “On a Median stone, engrave Herakles standing upright and throttling a lion; set it in a gold ring and give it to the patient to wear.”239\nThe last moment in the pre-Roman period for the interment of amber is toward the end of the fourth century B.C. This is documented by a concentration of finds on the central Adriatic coast and in southern Campania. Villalfonsina, Paestum, and Timmari are three exceptional finds: the subjects of the pendants are female heads or faces, joined into necklaces with spacer beads of various shapes.240 The finds at Paestum date after the Lucanian takeover of the site, as Angela Pontrandolfo Greco points out—critical evidence for the earlier appreciation of amber among the Lucanians.241 One of the latest examples of these necklaces was found at Timmari and dates to circa 330–20 B.C.242 From the late fourth century B.C. until the first century A.D., amber was a scarce grave good in Italy. The exceptions are a number of gold earrings in the shape of helmeted heads (the negroid heads are of amber) of the third century B.C., many of them from Etruria.243 Just like the earliest Etruscan and Greek ambers, these late manifestations of funereal figured amber objects are tiny. Yet their functions are still to protect, to avert danger, and, as fertile subjects, to promise rebirth. It was not until the revival of trade by the Romans that amber again became abundant in Italy. Figured amber objects, necklaces, rings, small vessels, and small, independent carvings once again were significant grave goods, particularly for women and children. Danger-averting gorgons, Dionysian and marine subjects, and other time-honored images of protection and regeneration dominated, continuing what was now a peninsular vocabulary for efficacious objects of amber.\nNotes Ancona, Museo Archeologico Nazionale 1154 (from Tomb 83, Belmonte Piceno): Citation: Rocco 1999Rocco, G.

Winter, Greek Architectural Terracottas: From the Prehistoric to the End of the Archaic Period (Oxford, 1993), has shown, the Temple of Artemis in Epidauros employed dog protome waterspouts, and this usage was widely followed in Campania and Latium in the second and first centuries B.C., particularly in private residences. She attributes this popularity to the dog's symbolism in the Greco-Roman world. Originally valued primarily as a hunter and, as such, the indispensable companion of gods and particularly of Artemis, the dog eventually assumed the role of guardian and companion and obtained apotropaic powers. Ancient authors attributed to dogs the power to forewarn of danger, and thus recommended their use as temple guardians.↩ British Museum 43: Citation: Strong 1966Strong, D. E.

The kneeling figures in Philadelphia are close enough in form to a type of Egyptian alabaster magical or medical vessel, imitated in “Rhodian” faïence, in the form of a kneeling woman, to invite further investigation, especially if E. Brunner-Traut, “Gravidenflasche,” in Archaeologie und altes Testament: Festschrift für Kurt Galling (Tübingen, 1970), pp. 35–48, is correct: that women used the ingredients of such vessels in magic, and rubbed the contents on the body during pregnancy. Such a faïence vessel was found in the Circolo dei Leonicini d'Argento III Tomb at Vetulonia. (Vetulonia, Museo Civico Archeologico “Isidoro Falchi” 116483: Citation: Bartoloni 2000Bartoloni, G., et al., eds. Principi etruschi tra Mediterraneo ed Europa. Exh. cat. Bologna, 2000., p. 3012, no. 413 [L. Pagnini], with earlier bibl.)\nThe Philadelphia ambers are formally and stylistically comparable to an amber pendant from an early-fifth-century female grave at Tolve-Magritiello, which is in the form of a short-chiton-wearing, front-facing, seated figure whose knees are close to the body and whose arms are crossed on the chest (illustrated in Citation: Magie d\u0026rsquo;ambra 2005Magie d\u0026rsquo;ambra: Amuleti e gioielli della Basilicata antica. Exh. cat. Potenza, 2005.). A. Russo (p. 114) suggests that it could be the work of an artisan from a Greco-Oriental culture and compares it to the sculpture of Samos. She suggests the amber was made in Magna Grecia and compares it to a small alabaster of Helen emerging from the egg, excavated at Metaponto.\nThe Tolve-Magritiello figure can also be compared to an Egyptian-derived kourotrophos-demon type of ancient Greece; see U. Sinn, “Zur wirkung des ägyptischen ‘Bes' auf die griechische Volksreligion,” in Antidoron: Festschrift für Jürgen Thimme, eds. D. Metzler, B. Otto, and C. Müller-Wirth (Stuttgart, 1989), pp. 87–94. (For Bes, see also n. 204.)\nCorinthian and Rhodian terracotta vessels in the form of squatting comasts offer parallels to many figured ambers. See, for example, V. Dasen, “Squatting Comasts and Scarab-Beetles,” in Citation: Tsetskhladze et al. 2000Tsetskhladze, G., A. J. N. W. Prag, and A. M. Snodgrass, eds. Periplous: Papers on Classical Art and Archaeology Presented to Sir John Boardman. London, 2000., p. 132:\nLike kourotrophic demons or the Cypriote forms of Bes and Ptah-Pataikos, the figures seem to have conveyed the Egyptian notion of dwarfs as healing gods and family guardians: their scaraboid features may also have translated into Greek idiom the Egyptian concept of scarab-beetles as regenerative and life-giving symbols.… Several … were found in tombs, and probably had a specific funerary meaning; one vessel in particular was found with two small silver bracelets and one Corinthian aryballos in a child's tomb from Ialysus. Others come from sanctuaries of female deities, such as that of Hera at Perachora or of Demeter at Gela; it is revealing that two vases were found with three statuettes of kourotrophic dwarfs in a votive deposit dedicated to Demeter at Catania. The association of squatting demons with the protection of fecundity is also suggested by the decoration of the comast from Isthmia: the figure has pendulous breasts, like Bes or Egyptian personifications of fecundity, and his belly is painted with a large phallus surrounded by phallic padded dancers.… The influence of Egyptian dwarf-gods is also perceptible in the iconography of Corinthian padded dancers, with bandy legs, protruding abdomens and buttocks like Bes figures, and likewise associated with music, wine and powers of fecundity.

Talismans égyptiens d\u0026rsquo;heureuse maternité: “Faïence” bleu vert à pois foncés. Paris, 1991.. The antiquity of such figures is suggested by the existence of dancing figures from before the fourth millennium; see Y. Garfinkel, Dancing at the Dawn of Agriculture (Austin, TX, 2003), who connects them to early agricultural ritual.\nOn the child-killing demons, see Citation: Johnston 1995Johnston, S.

Belgrade, 2006., p. 110, nothing can be inferred conclusively about the number of the bodies buried in Novi Pazar, or of their sex, or of whether the chest found under the church is the primary or secondary archaeological context. Palavestra considers the ambers' style to point to production centers in South Italy. While some works can be linked to ambers from southern Italy, the burial seemingly represents the work of many different artisans, traditions, and object-types, and it draws on a variety of sources for subject, style, and type. The other figured ambers in the Novi Pazar burial include part of a vessel, well-known plain beads, and pendants, as well as figured pendants, korai, rams' heads, and acorns. In addition, there are two large plaques, part of larger, more complex ornaments. One plaque is engraved with Herakles carrying the Cecropes on one side and with two hoplites on the other; the second is engraved with a rider and horse on one side and facing sphinxes on the other.\nThe ambers of a grave context excavated in 1896 at Sala Consilina (the finds are now in the Petit Palais, Paris) are still not fully published.

Among the animate subjects are a crouching sphinx, a tiny vase with crouching felines, a scallop shell, two rams' heads, two female faces, and the foreparts of a boar.

The variant subjects—some must be sirens, while others may represent harpies, chthonic beings, or the soul, or be related to the Egyptian ba-bird—may augment or focus certain aspects of amber. Without doubt, the composites all represent beings with some connection to death and the afterworld, and it is likely that the amber bird-woman carvings have magic in them. In amber are found most of the bird-woman composite creatures of Orientalizing–Archaic period art; they belong to several types of “siren” imagery, one close to the form of Rhodian terracotta vessels and probably related to the Egyptian ba-bird type, and others that are more like various Near Eastern–derived bird-female composites. Some are more like Oriental and early Greek sphinx types, others more like flying birds in an as-seen-from-below schema; some are more human than bird, and others more bird than human. As J. Leclercq-Marx, La Sirène dans la pensée et dans l'art de l'Antiquité et du Moyen Âge: Du mythe païen au symbole chrétien, Classe des beaux-arts, Académie royale de Belgique (Brussels, 1997), pp. 1–42, superbly sets out, “siren” encompasses many different things and beings, and a range of beliefs about them. Homer's sirens may not be Hesiod's. However, by the seventh century, an undoubtedly magical power is associated with them, and sometimes they are invoked as protective divinities for the deceased. Some are undoubtedly related to the sirens of the Odyssey; others must be linked more closely to the ba-bird, representing “the freedom and mobility of the spirit of the deceased”: S. Quirke, Ancient Egyptian Religion (London, 1992), p. 106. In Egypt, as Citation: Vermeule 1979Vermeule, E. Aspects of Death in Early Greek Art and Poetry. Berkeley, 1979., p. 76, points out, the ba-bird functioned as an agent to reintegrate a dead person: the ba could mediate between the living and the dead, bringing the sustenance of funeral gifts from the earth's surface to the deep tomb. In Homer's Odyssey (12.158–200), the sirens are “endowed with omniscient memory, including complete knowledge of the Trojan War.… In Greek literature, their presence foreshadows, accompanies, or otherwise refers to death”: M.

Essential was the siren's association with transport to the afterlife and with the underworld and the task of the spiritural nourishment of the dead. See also D.

That the sirens ranged along the coast of Italy, and that Parthenope was traditionally buried at Naples, may provide some explanation for the impressive number of amber sirens from documented Italian finds of the sixth to fourth centuries, a number of them from Campania. The sirens' watery origins (they are daughters of either Achelous, the river god, or of Phorkys and Ceto, sea divinities) must also have added to their powers. Since amber, too, was of water (originating in, hardened by, or borne by ocean, sea, rivers, or streams), material and subject reiterated each other.↩ The amber pendant is from Tomb 9, Rutigliano-Purgatorio Necropolis: see Citation: Negroni Catacchio 1993Negroni Catacchio, N. “The Production of Amber Figurines in Italy from the 8th to 4th Centuries B.C.” In Amber in Archaeology: Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Amber in Archaeology, Liblice, 1990, edited by C.

London, 1997., p. 99: “It is not surprising that Mars and warrior heroes such as Theseus, Achilles or Alexander the Great were often shown on red stones, carnelians and jaspers, for red is the colour of blood and life.” In late antiquity, hematite was chosen for magical amulets, as notes G. Vikan, “Magic and Visual Culture,” in Greek Magic: Ancient, Medieval, and Modern, ed. J. C. B. Petropoulos (Abingdon and New York, 2008), p. 55, because of its “persuasive parallel”; as an iron oxide, it can hold its “blood” red within its shiny black skin. Perhaps amber that was more red than yellow was selected for martial subjects. If the amber were not red enough, it could be colored, as Pliny relates (Natural History 37.12): “tinted, as desired, with kid suet and the root of alkanet. Indeed, it is now stained even with purple dye.” In discussing the making of artificial transparent stones (Natural History 37.12), he mentions this possibility again: “It can be dyed any color.” D. E. Eichholz's gloss (Citation: Eichholz 1962Pliny. Natural History. Books 36–37. Translated by D. E. Eichholz. Loeb Classical Library 419. Cambridge, 1962., p. 200, n. a) explains: “The modern technique is to open a fissure, introduce colouring matter and heat the amber. The root of the alkanet, which was commonly used for rouge in antiquity, would have reddened it.”↩\n On the large and animated eye, see Citation: Steiner 2001Steiner, D. T.

Satyrs are images of Dionysos' power as well as creatures of the world of the dead.… The connection of sexual or scatological activity with the circle of Fufluns in Etruscan tombs seems to urge a connection between sexuality and death that can present apotropaic meanings as well as notions of fertility and continuity between life and death.” The representations of male figures disguised as satyrs on funerary objects, such as the dance of a woman and a man disguised as a satyr on the funerary cippus from Chiusi (Chiusi, Museo Archeologico Nazionale 2284), may shed light on amber imagery and the role of amulets in the grave. Citation: Haynes 2000Haynes, S. Etruscan Civilization: A Cultural History. Los Angeles, 2000., pp. 246–47, discusses the Etruscan staged funerary performances “with satyrs or silenoi: the pairs of women (maenads?) with tall, draped headdresses; nude boys dancing with castanets.” These are the same subjects that are found in fifth- and early-fourth-century amber carvings, the same subjects that are found on vases painted by the Micali Painter and his followers.\nDionysos's importance in the life of children in ancient Greece is evidenced by the spring festival of Anthesteria, one that celebrated new growth and transformation. His role in healing, magic, and protection (especially of children) deserves greater attention. Dionysos's own infancy and childhood were significant in myth, and he was a revered father. Might this have contributed, too, to his place in the protection of the young?↩\n Cole 1993 (231, above), pp. 277–79.↩ E. R.

In Euripides' Herakles Furens, the hero repulses the attack of the demonic (Gorgon) and “assumes the same appearance and powers as the invading force: issuing ‘terrifying looks,’ and he rolls his Gorgon-like eyes”: Citation: Steiner 2001Steiner, D. T. Images in Mind: Statues in Archaic and Classical Greek Literature and Thought. Princeton, 2001., p. 171. Herakles' survival of Chiron's fatal poison might have made him a “wounded healer” (similia similibus curantur). His role in spring cults and his sanative aspects relate to his successful cleansing with water of the Augean stables and other exploits. Water was a healing agent, a carrier of omens, and a supporter of fertility. On classical spring cults, see F. Muthmann, Mutter und Quelle: Studien zur Quellenverehrung im altertum und im Mittelalter (Basel, 1975).\nIn private worship especially, Herakles was commonly appealed to as a defender against evils and a victor over them.

Because of its inherent properties, it is likely that amber was worked by any number of skilled craftspeople or artisans. Considering its magical and medicinal importance, amber must also have been worked by a multiplicity of ritual specialists-pharmacists, “wise women,” priests or priestesses, and by “those who had the knowledge.”244 However, for the working of very large carvings, or for amber fibulae composed from conjoined pieces, considerable experience with varying qualities of amber was essential.\nAn artisan comfortable in working other hard organic materials, such as hardwoods, ivory, or horn, or one skilled in cutting gems, would have found working amber comparatively undemanding. Amber is also pleasant to work, for it is fragrant, unlike ivory.\nA number of scholars have proposed that amber was worked by ivory-workers. Certainly, the tool marks on the objects in the Getty collection (and elsewhere) show that eighth- to fourth-century B.C. amber objects were made with a toolkit probably no different from that of a Bronze Age ivory-worker, for which there is excellent archaeological evidence.245 (Much less is known about the pre-Roman period.) In fact, amber-working today has changed very little, with the exception of the speed offered by electric tools. Like Bronze Age toolkits, pre-Roman ones likely would have included bow drills, chisels, saws, knives or blades, points, awls, burins, rule and compass, vices, abrasives, oils, metal foils, pigments, and glues. The surviving evidence of amber from the Iron Age and beyond—furnishings, arms and armor, utensils, boxes, vessels, dress ornaments, and amulets—shows that amber was in the supply of many kinds of trained workers. Some composite works—furniture inlaid with ivory and amber; ivory carvings inlaid with amber; bronze fibulae ornamented with amber and ivory (figure 51); and amber carvings embellished with ivory and precious metals—are additional concrete evidence for the existence of artisans working in more than one medium.246 The evidence is also found in many surviving multimedia works, such as one type of seventh-century fibula made from ivory, amber, gold, and bronze, or a work such as the Getty Head of a Female Divinity or Sphinx (see figure 45), an amber face with metal additions (possibly silver) and once, perhaps, inlaid eyes.247\n a \u0026amp; b.

By permission of il Ministero per i Beni e le Attività Culturali-Direzione Regionale per i Beni Culturali e Paesaggistici della Puglia-Soprintendenza per I Beni Archeologici della Puglia     Many figured ambers, particularly those of the seventh to fifth centuries B.C., are similar in style to contemporary and earlier works in other media, such as gemstones, coins, terracottas, and bronzes. However, they are closest in manufacture, and often in subject, to objects of ivory or wood. The amber kouros in London is very close in form to a wood kouros excavated at Marseilles and to a pair of tiny ivory Etruscan kouroi.248 The Getty plaque Addorsed Lions\u0026rsquo; Heads with Boar in Relief (see figure 30) is very like an ivory relief. Works such as the exquisite chryselephantine “Artemis” and “Apollo” from Delphi249 are among the closest parallels for the Getty Head of a Female Divinity or Sphinx (see figure 18) and the Getty Kore (see figure 46), not only for the style, but also for details such as the eyes.\nThe pre-Roman ambers themselves yield considerable evidence of their manufacture. The traces of working consist of carving, cuts, filed grooves, drill pointing and drilling rills, abrasion scratches, engraving, and fine burnishing. Supplemented by both earlier (Bronze Age) and later (Roman) physical evidence, medieval and early modern treatises, and still-current methods of amber-working, a picture of their manufacture comes into focus.\nThe process of creating the objects likely began with careful study of the piece of amber. Some ambers must have been worked from the raw state, others from preexisting finished works. In some cases, the raw material was treated as if it were any other costly material, and little trace exists of the natural form of the amber, whether drop, rod, or sheet. However, in other cases, the ancient resin\u0026rsquo;s naturally occurring form is retained and sometimes even exploited in the finished object; the Getty Hippocamp (figure 52), Kourotrophoi (figures 35 and 53), and Lion (figure 55) are good examples.\n  fullscreen Figure 52    Hippocamp Pendant, Etruscan, 575–550 B.C.

If the work were begun with a raw piece of amber retaining its outer skin, or cortex, it was necessary to remove it and any encrusted material, organic matter, or shells. This was likely done with saws, abrasive powders, and water. The fissures would be cleared of organic matter and hard minerals, the pyrites. In amber-working, water acts as both a coolant and a lubricant in the shaping, smoothing, and drilling processes, since the ancient resin softens or melts with the application of high friction.250 The resulting surface of an amber blank was smooth but uneven, with craters and undulations. In the seventh century, an artisan might remove a large amount of material to attain the desired form; in fifth-century B.C. Italy, the design would be accommodated to the irregular (magical) shape. The twelfth-century A.D. guide to working crystal by Theophilus probably outlines the next steps that are corroborated by the tooling remains on both pre-Roman and Roman-period ambers. The medieval treatise states: “Rub it with both hands on a hard sandstone moistened with water until it takes on the shape you want to give it; then on another stone of the same kind, which is finer and smoother, until it becomes completely smooth.”251\nTheophilus then suggests the use of a flat abrasive surface to sand the nodule. Evidence of this is found on the remarkably well-preserved flat inside of the Getty pendant Head of a Female Divinity or Sphinx (see figure 18).\nThe amber pieces must have been further abraded, carved, graved, and polished into the desired subjects, perhaps refined with engraving (and, more rarely, drilling). Sketching was likely done with a sharp scriber of metal, stone, or flint.252 Pliny refers to “Ostacias” (possibly flint), which is “so hard that other gemstones are engraved with it.”253 Engraving required a rotating instrument, such as a bow drill, the standard tool of a gem engraver.\nThe narrow-bore suspension perforations, usually transverse, were drilled with particular attention to how the pendant would hang or would attach to a carrier. The narrowness of the borings suggests that the ambers would have been suspended from plant filaments, such as linen, or silk. Many larger pendants have multiple long borings, again usually transverse, signifying that more than a simple filament was needed for the suspension, or that the pendant was part of a complex beaded apron, neck ornament, or girdle or was sewn directly onto clothing. The large Ship with Figures (see figure 6) and the Getty Kourotrophos group (figures 35 and 53), to name two examples, have multiple perforations and would have required more than one carrier, and a system of knots. The circa 600 B.C. multipiece pendant in Trieste254 and the circa 500 B.C. composite pendants from Novi Pazar255 were made possible by complicated stringing/knotting systems. The through-borings are all visible in the transparent amber.\nNot only would the stringing have secured the pendants, but both the knots and the action of tying the knots were critical to amuletic usage. In magical practice, tying a knot implies hindering negative actions. Demons and their corresponding diseases were believed to be caught by knots, bands, threads, strings, and amulets. Knots thus could actively play a protective or benevolent role. The pendant-amulets would have been tied on, attached, or suspended as an essential aspect of their efficacy, as we learn from ancient literary sources.256 The large frontal holes of some figured works are secondary to the transverse perforations and, as discussed below, could be used to attach works to pins or even to a piece of furniture.\nThe final stage of the work was probably to polish the surface, likely with oil and a fine abrasive or cloth. To bring out the brilliance of the stone, Theophilus instructs: “Finally, put the tile rubbings, moistened with spittle, on a goatskin free of dirt and grease, which is stretched on a wooden frame and secured below with nails, and carefully rub the crystal on this until it sparkles all over.” For amber, such polishing and rubbing would bring up the luster and the fragrance, releasing the amber\u0026rsquo;s ambrosial perfume; if that were not enough, the piece could have been rubbed with perfumed oils. We might imagine how this would have added to amber\u0026rsquo;s attraction and mystery, especially if it were a divine image. The delicious odor might have “[matched] the emanation of fragrance that forms so regular a part of divine epiphanies.”257 As a divine characteristic, fragrance was itself imbued with the power of everlasting life.\nAll of the surviving pre-Roman figured ambers (at the Getty Museum and elsewhere) reveal an understanding of the morphological and structural characteristics of the ancient resin. Compositions tend to be compact, without projecting parts; the potential points of weakness are minimized in the designs. In human figures, legs and feet are close together, arms and hands are attached to bodies, and necks are short; animals may have their legs tucked beneath themselves, heads reverted, and tails curled around their haunches. The best-preserved works retain signs of surface burnishing, which once enhanced the optical qualities of the amber: its transparency, brilliance, luster, and color.\nThe earliest figured amber objects from Greece and Italy, dating to the eighth to seventh centuries, are small, from about 48 mm, and frequently imitate small-scale sculptural objects in other media, including ornaments and amulets. The Orientalizing amber carvings are comparable to works in ivory, bone, wood, faïence, precious metals, gemstones, and bronze. Many appear to be direct translations into amber. Examples are the Egyptian and Egyptianizing scarabs, scaraboids, monkeys, dwarves, and other time-honored amuletic subjects. In these small works, there is no evidence of the amber\u0026rsquo;s natural shape, and little wastage. Some excess may have been used to make tiny beads or inlay, as flux in goldsmithing258 or as incense or medicine. A number of pendants in the Getty collection, all dating to about the last third of the sixth century B.C., correspond closely to objects of Ionian Greek (or Ionian-influenced) art. Among the finest examples are the two Heads of a Female Divinity or Sphinx (see figures 18 and 45), the Kore (see figure 46), and some of the rams\u0026rsquo; and lions\u0026rsquo; heads.\nA different approach to the material emerged at the beginning of the sixth century B.C. The natural form of the amber nodule is preserved, even enhanced, by the design. Some objects, such as the Getty Hippocamp (figure 52), suggest that the lumpy nodule of amber may even have dictated the subject. The subjects of the multifigure pendants are distorted as they wrap around the exceptionally large amber pieces. In order to comprehend the entire subject, the pendant needs to be physically turned in every direction. In any one view, the figures are deformed; but as the pendant is turned, the shapes shift. The Boston Dancing Youth (figure 54) and the British Museum Satyr and Maenad (see figure 17) are excellent illustrations of this approach. The compositions are illogical, the scale of the figures is skewed, parts are missing, the heads and bodies are twisted or wrapped around the amber in an anatomically impossible manner. Is this because of the sanctity of the whole piece of amber? Are the figures deformed as part of the magic, the shapes shifting as the object is turned over? Might this shape shifting—a common demonic talent—be part of the attraction?259\n Dancing Figure. Etruscan or Italic, early 5th century. Amber, 7.2 x 3.7 cm (2 13/16 x 1 7/16 in.).

Photograph © 2011 Museum of Fine Arts, Boston     A variant of this approach is seen in a number of animal subjects, best exemplified by the Getty Lion (figure 55). In this work, there must have been no appreciable wastage. The natural form of the amber blank is obvious and the subject embellishes, rather than conceals, the idiosyncrasies of the raw material. In such cases, the outline, depth, and undulations of the surface are incorporated into the design, with the result that animals and anthropomorphic figures are compacted, splayed, or contorted.260 A few anthropomorphic pendants are worked in the round, but many have flattish, plain backs. Since the amber was transparent, the carving would have been visible from any angle, an extraordinary sight especially if the piece was figured on all sides. The reverse of the Lion allows it to be seen from below, a view only chthonic beings might have. These are extraordinary sculptural objects; in the ancient world, perhaps only in-the-round rock crystal carvings are comparable.261\nThere are precedents as early as the third millennium for the figural manipulation and contortion of pre-Roman amber objects. Many examples can be found in the art of the Near East in objects dating to the fourth millennium and the Aegean Bronze Age. Ivories, amulets, and stone vessels are figure-wrapped. However, this is not common in Greek art. In Italy, the earliest parallels are in Etruria, in bronze vessel attachments and scaraboids. The outstanding examples of a wraparound composition on a large scale are the stairway sculptures of circa 560 B.C. from a possible altar at the side of a clan tumulus at Cortona.262 The extreme examples of figure contortion are certain pre-Roman amber pendants, of which the earliest might be associated with neighborhood of Cortona. Was it done only to preserve as much of the amber as possible—not just because of amber\u0026rsquo;s high value, but also because of the efficacy of the resulting images? Might it also have been done because such contortion was a way to magically “bind” or control the potency of the subject? Were the subjects of the British Museum Vintaging Satyr or the Getty Hippocamp (figure 52) bound in order to strengthen their power?263\nMany human and humanoid heads contain drillings, or stopped bores, many of which were filled with tiny amber plugs, on average 2 to 3 mm in diameter and 5 mm in length. These holes are on the face, in the hair and headdress, on the neck, or on the obverse, but were never drilled into the facial features. Only sometimes are they found in areas with inclusions. It is not apparent why the holes were bored and then plugged. The holes might have been made to render the pendant more consistently translucent, or to remove a microscopic bubble or an inclusion. Alternatively, the amber may have been drilled specifically in order to insert something into the bore, which was then plugged. Amulet-making and medicinal recipes often include directions for inserting materials into another object.264 Many of the plugs are now missing, but the remaining ones are often darker and more opaque than the rest of the pendants. This is probably not an intended effect, but a result of the plugs\u0026rsquo; accelerated oxidation.265 The Getty Asinine Head in Profile (figure 56) has four large stopped bores, but none of the plugs remain. This pendant is full of inclusions, and the stopped bores penetrate into areas with inclusions. On the other hand, the Getty Winged Female Head in Profile (see figure 37) has numerous stopped bores, some in areas with visible inclusions, others in areas that appear to be inclusion-free.\n Asinine Head in Profile Pendant, Italic, 500–400 B.C.

A number of fifth- to fourth-century B.C. amber pendants from southern Italy have large holes drilled through their middles. Four examples are still attached to large fibulae.266 The large holes disfigure the design and must have been drilled after the carving was finished, perhaps much later. In the case of four other pendants, including a Satyr Head (see figure 49) that retains its silver fibula, the holes are incorporated into the design, which implies that the perforations preexisted the figural composition. The large holes may have originated in the amber\u0026rsquo;s formation (the resin could have formed around a small branch) or in a previous use: the pendants might have been carved from older works, perhaps large, plain beads or pin decorations. It is also possible that these large holes were made to remove inclusions, or to insert something into the amber—both are commensurate with magico-medical practice. Alternatively, the secondary perforations may have been drilled to destroy the power of the image.\nNotes Citation: Dickie 2001Dickie, M. Magic and Magicians in the Greco-Roman World.

From these, a picture of the basic ivory-worker's toolkit has been reconstructed. See Citation: Lapatin 2001Lapatin, K. D. S. Chryselephantine Statuary in the Ancient Mediterranean World.

(Louvain-la-Neuve and Providence, RI, 1984), pp. 255–59.\nSimple amber beads and pendants would not have required tools much different from those used to work amber in the Mesolithic period. Sophisticated Mesolithic carvings from Denmark and Lithuania, for example, likely were made with stone tools and polished with ground minerals, leather, or cloth and common lubricants, such as water or fat. For amber-working, see also S. Zanini, “Cenni sulla lavorazione e il commercio dell'ambra,” in Gioielli del Museo Archeologico di Padova: Vetri, bronzi, metalli preziosi, ambre e gemme, exh. cat., ed. G.

New York, 2001., chap. 2 and p. 134, for a discussion of ivory-working and the “ivory worker.” What Lapatin notes about chryselephantine works by the best sculptors has resonance for the finest amber carvings: “Although not a single ‘original’ that can confidently be attributed to any of these sculptors has survived, many of these craftsmen are reported to have also produced statues in other media. The chryselephantine technique was, after all, a composite one, and processes of production can be discerned not only from ancient anecdotes … but also from the evidence of closely related wood working from other periods and cultures.”↩\n That craftsmen worked in a variety of materials is suggested by a range of “multimedia” furnishings and other kinds of objects from very early times throughout the Mediterranean and the ancient Near East. The Late Bronze Age Adriatic site of Frattesina shows evidence of bone, horn, ivory, amber, and glassworking. This accords with archaeological evidence from Mycenaean workshops that different materials were worked at the same place: precious metals, glass paste, shells, amber, rock crystal, steatite, onyx, amethyst, agate, and lapis lazuli.

This may push the concept of shape shifting, but such a concept is relevant for the magical aspects of some amber pendants. The appearance of shape shifting could be conceived as an attestation to the artisan's skill in making what were perhaps to be considered daidala. ↩ Because of this, each amber object is unique. Figures contorted, splayed, or wrapped around planes are seen in ancient Near Eastern animal representations as early as the fourth millennium, and some Mycenaean ivories and Middle Assyrian alabaster vessels suggest that such figure manipulation was well established much earlier. Of the art made in or imported into pre-Roman Italy, contorted and splayed figures are found in ivory work, in scaraboids, plastic vases, some bronzes (especially utilitarian items such as feet or handles), and gold objects of adornment. An early example is the ivory lion group from the Barberini Tomb (Museo Nazionale Etrusco di Villa Giulia, Rome), thought by Citation: Brown 1960Brown, W. L. The Etruscan Lion. Oxford, 1960., p. 5, to be Syrian work. The resonance in Etruria for wrapping figures (divine, heroic, and demonic subjects most especially) around planes may reflect several generations of contact with art from the Orient. Eastern Greece seems to have been a direct source not only for the large-scale stone carving of the Cortona altar, but also for later, small-scale bronzework, such as the Vulcian naked youth riding the winged lion of an incense burner's foot (circa 450, from Olympia: Olympia Museum B 1001) and the (possibly Orvietan) bronze tripod feet with representations of Peleus wrestling Thetis and Perseus decapitating Medusa (circa 470–60, provenance unknown: Florence, Museo Archeologico Nazionale 710–11).

This places greater importance on works with solid documentation for a discussion of culture and meaning. It is often the case that findspot is equated with place of origin, and grave goods are associated with ownership by the deceased or assumed to be direct evidence of daily dress and customs. The existence of high-value objects such as amber and gold in elite graves must be considered in light of their role as ingredients in a larger network of cultural relationships. Amber and gold, incense and precious textiles were internationally recognized prestigious and valuable objects, suitable for exchange, gift-giving, and status display. Not all objects were new. They may have been tokens of guest friendship, or heirlooms or funerary gifts from family or clan members or other relationships. Such “antiques” may have been valued for their history, provenance, or established efficacy (sacral, magical, or medicinal). Celebrations of alliances, marriages, and other rituals were likely occasions for the gathering, exchange, special commissioning, and social display of such objects. Some ambers may have been highly prized prestige objects—treasures gained from purchase, plunder, or presentation—and were meant to be circulated within an aristocratic network. Emporia, palaces, or possibly sacred sites might support established as well as itinerant artisans. And the gifting of things, old and new, could not have been a rare occurrence in the pre-Roman period when amber reigned. Travel and travelers (for reasons of commerce, politics, religion, or celebration) meant gatherings of people at sanctuaries and “princely” centers, where high-status objects might be purchased or commissioned, and where jewelry or magic or medicine may have been procured. The “‘cultural clearing houses,’ the intermediate centers where goods and ideas were received, adapted, mixed—and passed on,”267 places such as Pithecoussai and Rhodes in earlier centuries, or a city such as Vulci in the sixth century B.C., are important examples to consider. The extent to which the existence of such centers resulted in a web of autonomous secondary routes—along with a whole range of other cultural outcomes268—demands our attention, especially with a mythic material such as elektron. An indigenous palatial center such as Braida di Serra di Vaglio (Potenza, Basilicata) is an Italic example of a place where the “circulation” of both objects and people, and interchange among foreigners and colonial Greeks and Etruscans and the indigenous population, might be found. Traders and makers of amber objects might include residents as well as itinerants.\nIt is important to say a word about style: the efficacy of pre-Roman ambers may have been determined in part by the resin\u0026rsquo;s assured provenance (from the north), by its form (it should follow established guidelines or a prescription), and by its appropriate style(s). The very duration of time-honored forms and style—the long life of Egyptian subjects and forms in amber, or the importance of Ionian- and Etruscan-looking ambers deep into the fourth century B.C.—underlines the conservative functions of figured ambers. It was seemingly important that works look as if they were made by, or followed the prescriptions of, Egyptians, Ionians, or Etruscans. This visual resemblance, perhaps a stamp of authenticity, may have assured their potency or “branded” the objects\u0026rsquo; magic. In this way, the style, “a way of doing things,”269 is a culturally significant variable. In the case of amuletic ambers, the style can be said to play a critical role in defining the genuineness and efficacy of the objects. In addition, there appear to be prototypes—not only schemata, but actual models—that were followed for centuries. It is possible that certain works were on view for a long period, through public display in ceremonial circumstances or via circulation. If some works were family or clan heirlooms, they may have been valued for one or more reasons, economic, sacral, medical, or magical. To find individual style in a copy of a copy is a challenge indeed.\nIn a search for the artistic origins of some figured ambers, scholars have tended to look for individual hands, schools, and centers of production. Connoisseurship and archaeological sleuthing have identified master artisans. Much progress also has been made in siting some groups of objects, drawing them around schools or the hand of particular artisans, and there are undeniable stylistic connections between groups of carved ambers.270 However, there are many reasons to consider paradigms that move beyond individuals, workshops, and centers of manufacture. As touched on above, many students of figured ambers see an undeniable Etruscan connection in the subjects and “art” of these objects. Some emphasize Magna Graecian, Campanian, Lucanian, or other Italic elements. This author has long advocated for the Ionian, and even more specifically the Milesian, aspects of many amber pendants.271 Other scholars, notably Negroni Catacchio, have charted well-stated arguments for several regional centers.272 Canosa is a good candidate for the fifth century B.C., as Angelo Bottini has argued.273 Armento is another.274\nBut why (and where in) these centers? Was there a religious site or sacred sanctuary there? A market? A venerable studio? A school of pharmacology? Raw materials and finished products were easily portable, and not only was the use of amber amulets pervasive, but the iconography of some types—the pendant in the form of a detached head (figure 57), to cite the most numerous—was consistent over time. There is also evidence that carvings of different dates and styles could be buried together, as in the grave of the young girl of Tomb 102 at Braida di Vaglio.275\n Lion’s Head Spout or Finial, Etruscan, 525–480 B.C.

Although it is possible that itinerant craftsmen produced the amber carvings of pre-Roman Italy, and that they did so in court settings, as has been proposed,276 these hypothetical models emphasize the craft and deemphasize the special function of figured amber objects in medicine, magic, and mourning.277\nThe terms craftsman and artisan imply métier, instruction, apprenticeship or training, and the production of art. It must be kept in mind that amber is relatively soft and easy to work and was not, of necessity, the exclusive province of skilled artisans. While the Getty pendant Head of a Female Divinity or Sphinx (see figure 45) may be equal to the finest of contemporary temple dedications or cult imagery of the period, many figured ambers are art only by modern definition. The material was the force behind its usage, and therefore, the workers of amber might well encompass pharmacists and religious functionaries, including priests or priestesses, magicians, healers, seers, midwives, and sorceresses.278 Was an amber object an heirloom, a gift, an exchange object? Or was it produced and/or purchased at a time of crisis? What was most important about these objects was how well they worked: as social indicators, as prestige objects, as gifts, as items in transition rituals, as ornamentation, materia medica, and amulets. Amuletically, knowledge of the incantations necessary to accompany them and their specific magical role was essential. Any analysis of how ambers functioned for the living and the dead needs first to consider who would have possessed such information.\nIn what activity was an amber involved? This question is especially important when it comes to the most long-lived and geographically widespread amulet types, of which a substantial number (early as well as late) are schematic in manufacture. The sixth-century B.C. female heads from Eretum, for example, are small and schematic, their features formed primarily by abrasion.279 Such is also the case with a number of crude heads in the Getty collection. Since both the material and the subjects of pre-Roman amber amulets suggest an association with healing, the protection of women, infants, and children, and the aversion of danger, some may have been acquired at the sanctuaries of healing divinities, where old traditions were kept alive or powerful images were on view in special settings or ceremonies. Some pieces may have been spoils, gifts, or dedications.\nThere is much to be learned about the making of power objects, jewelry, and amulets from Egypt and Mesopotamia, where the literary sources and the archaeological evidence are especially rich, and from the later Greek tradition of inscribed amulets, among the earliest of which were found in the south of Italy. With noninscribed amulets, the situation is more complicated and more open to misinterpretation. Nevertheless, information can be mined from earlier, concurrent, and later traditions. Especially valuable are ancient amulets with writing, which appear frequently in Roman times, as well as ancient handbooks with instructions on the preparation of rites and amulets. These reveal a great deal about the workings of amulets: the stated purpose, the ingredients, the time and place for performance, accompanying gestures, and the incantations themselves. For specific objects, however, we still may never know the answer to the question “Was the preparation, inscription, or donning of the amulet conceived or enacted as a ritual act or in a purely perfunctory manner?”280\nThe differing possibilities for who made the amber pendant heads, and in what kind of context, are not necessarily mutually exclusive. A female head-pendant excavated at Lavello may be a local product, for it has formal connections with earlier Etruscan art, with the art of (Laconian) Taranto, and with local Italic production, as Cecilia D\u0026rsquo;Ercole has shown.281 Was it carved by a local artisan who offered up key elements of the image in her/his own style? What was the model? How old was it, and where was it seen? Or was it made by an itinerant who had absorbed a large visual vocabulary, sculptural repertoire, or pharmacopoeia—whatever the correct lexicon may be? And according to which traditions, and which kind of “instructions”? Another example might be a group of pendants in the form of frontal female heads in the British Museum, possibly found together at Armento, which some scholars believe are Campanian, or made under Campanian influence, as is Donald Strong\u0026rsquo;s opinion.282 In each of the two cases, the heads may have been produced at a sanctuary of the divinity represented in the amber, by a local carver as a commissioned good, by an itinerant, for the open market, or even as filled “prescriptions.” Relevant here are the critical questions Jean Turfa asks about offerings and exchange in Greek votive tradition: “The large number of terracottas manufactured from the same molds or workshops at sites like Kirrha, the staging port for Delphi, suggests seasonal production or supply from factory to sanctuary, and thus the sanctuary as the ‘retail’ supplier of votives.”283 These heads, like all amber amulets, were valuable in every sense, and their value may have depended in part on where or by whom they were made. And they were just the sort of thing to have accrued further value by being displayed, worn, or buried at a place distant from their manufacture. A carved amber or group of ambers may have been carried in the pouch of an itinerant artisan, trader, or healer. Before it played a role in a sanctuary or in the rituals of death, the amber may have been traded or gifted elsewhere, to be copied or remembered. Carved ambers may have had many lives and been involved in many activities. Made from a material as old as the earth, formed into deeply significant subjects only to be interred once again, these gems of the ages offer new windows onto the past.\nNotes Ridgway 2000 (n. 192), p. 236.↩ Ridgway 2000 (n. 192), p. 236, with reference to A.

Subject also relates them. Because of this, and because the six were part of the same donation, it is posited that they come from the same original context.\nAs is argued below, the six were produced in northern internal Etruria in the first half (or perhaps in the third quarter) of the sixth century B.C. and have stylistic connections to Greek Arcadian and Ionian small bronzes as well as to contemporary Etruscan votive bronzes, relief work, and bucchero. All can be shown to have specific ties to subjects and styles current in the Near East and Cyprus. The North Syrian and “Phoenician” aspects are salient.\nThese objects would have belonged to an elite person. The size alone of the largest three pendants would have signaled their exceptional value even before craftsmanship transformed the lumps of amber into traditional subjects of great power and status. As ornaments and amulets, the ambers could not but have made a spectacular impression, if only because of the optical characteristics of the rare material and its associations. The imagery enhanced the amber’s value. The age-old vocabulary that gave form to these glistening jewels made them good luck–inviting, danger-averting, protective objects. Although there are no close parallels in amber or other media for the individual works or the group, they belong to the vocabulary, iconography, and styles of Etruscan Orientalizing art. The subjects are women, children, and wild fauna—hares and migrating waterfowl. In format, the six include three heraldic compositions, a squared-up group of a lion with its prey, and two pairs of an adult and child in a side-by-side pose.\nAll six ambers are better understood when looked at in the context of contemporary and slightly earlier production from Greece, especially from the Peloponnesus and South Ionia, as well as ivories, bronzes, gold, faïence, and shell carvings from the Near East and Cyprus, including Cypro-Phoenician objects, and Orientalizing carved ambers and ivories from Picenum and Latium. This is a range similar to the visual vocabularies of other Orientalizing amber and ivory carvings, as carefully analyzed by A. M. Bisi and G. Rocco (for Picene ivory and bone carvings), P. G. Warden (for four “Picene” ambers in the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Philadelphia), and D. Waarsenburg (for ambers from Satricum in the Villa Giulia).1 Similarly rich stylistic and iconographic links are characteristic of some Orientalizing bronze reliefs, Praenestine ivory work, and Felsine stelai, and many of small finds from Samos, a number of unique carvings in wood and in ivory in particular.2 Because of the Etruscan aspects of the Italian-provenanced works, it seems most likely that they all were produced on the peninsula for locally based commissioners and purchasers.\nThe realia of the amber figures’ thoroughly Etruscan dress is matched by the waterfowl depictions. The bird of Citation: 77.AO.85Cat. no. 2 is a white-fronted goose and that of the Lion with Bird pendant, a mute swan. These species have long histories in the ancient world and its art, and both long-necked waterfowl accrued a rich lore and symbolism. The species are highly distinctive migrants to Italy and Europe, and both are excellent table fare. The hare, too, is good eating.\nEach of the six might also have been read as incorporations, or as symbolic, of a female nature divinity. This may be the principal divinity of popular Etruscan religion, who was worshipped in a variety of forms and under different names.3\nAlthough the six may have been used during the life of one or more powerful persons, some of their iconography seems to be funerary: the right-hand-on-breast gesture made by the figures of Citation: 77.AO.84Cat. no. 1, Citation: 77.AO.85Cat. no. 2, and Citation: 77.AO.81.1Cat. no. 3, the common mantle of Citation: 77.AO.85Cat. no. 2, and the hares of Citation: 77.AO.82Cat. no. 4 may have held special funerary meaning. Further study may support the identification of the large female figures as divinities with chthonic as well as afterworld aspects; the same may be true of the waterfowl and hares. Individually and as a group, the six remarkable ambers invite questions about their commissioning, making, owning, and burial. At this point, it is feasible to interpret these as the property of one or more political-ceremonial specialists, and to posit that these amulet-ornaments may have served as insignia.4\nThere are only a few documented pre-Roman burials with significant numbers of figured ambers. All the intact, published graves also included numerous other high-status objects, providing not only evidence of the elaborate rituals that accompanied the deceased, but also a glimpse of ideas about the tomb and the afterworld. These comparison burials, which are rich in figured amber, also contain nonfigured amber beads and pendants, plus many other high-value objects, of bronze, precious metals, ivory, or ceramics, among their durable goods. Textiles and other now-perished organic goods that must have accompanied the deceased have left few traces. These six pendants then may be evidence of what must have been an extraordinary burial.\nNotes   A. M.

Amsterdam, 1995. discuss in detail the representation of Great Mother in the Orientalizing period, with special attention to Astarte. There is a visible absorption of a female nature divinity’s aspects by several female and male divinities, but the concept of a Great Goddess is fraught, as Citation: Moorey 2004Moorey, R. S. Catalogue of the Ancient Near Eastern Terracottas in the Ashmolean. Oxford, 2004. points out. ↩ For this idea, compare the placing of certain ritual pre-Columbian gold objects in the graves of political-ceremonial specialists by other specialists. For example, in the Costa Rican Guanacaste and Central regions, finds from funerary contexts show that both new and previously used objects were deposited. Some are local, but there is also evidence of interchanges from around the region. The production of sumptuary and ritualistic objects in diverse materials suggests the existence of such specialists, who required the use of insignias associated with those possessions, which, at some point, were deposited in graves. The archaeological evidence suggests that during the period of A.D. 300–800, as these societies became more hierarchical, with greater social stratification, there was greater consolidation of experts in political-ritualistic activities, and the number and quality of grave offerings increased and changed. There is also evidence, represented by more images in clay, of women carrying out various roles. See, for example, S. K. Lothrop, Archaeology of the Diquis Delta, Costa Rica, Papers of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University 51 (Cambridge, MA, 1963). ↩   ","id":21,"length":1504,"title":"Orientalizing Group","type":"contents","url":"https://gettypubs.github.io/ambers/objects/groups/1/"},{"content":" Provenance 1977, Gordon McLendon (Dallas, TX), donated to the J. Paul Getty Museum, 1977.\nCondition The pendant is intact and in good condition. There is a long, curved fissure in the lower right section of the larger figure\u0026rsquo;s heavy cloak, extending to the base. There are numerous minute chips on the child\u0026rsquo;s head and on the adult\u0026rsquo;s nose, chin, and the left side of the neck and along the cloak\u0026rsquo;s left shoulder. There is an old chip on the tip of the hat. A pattern of minute cracking extends over the surface of the entire piece. There are inclusions at the hem on the right side, at the right elbow, at the top of the child\u0026rsquo;s head, and scattered throughout the adult\u0026rsquo;s body. The pendant\u0026rsquo;s patina varies from yellow-ocher to brown. In ambient light, the amber is reddish brown, and in transmitted light, translucent and ruby-red.\nDescription The two figures form a compact composition. The physiognomy, pose, gestures, dress, and relative scale of the figures suggest that the larger figure is a woman and the smaller figure is a child. The woman wears a long, heavy cloak and a conical hat and is shod in close-fitting boots. The raised area at the collarbone suggests the presence of a close-fitting undergarment. Although there is no sign of the undergarment\u0026rsquo;s hems or selvage edges, it is probably a long, close-fitting, unbelted chiton. Bunched cloth at the top of the cloak forms a kind of collar at the back of the neck and around the shoulders. Engraved vertical lines extend from the lower edge of the sleeve slits to the hem. On the left side, the cloak hem falls to the ankles, just above the small feet, and on the right, to ground level. The two front edges of the cloak join low on the chest at the woman\u0026rsquo;s solar plexus. Her open right hand is placed at this junction. Her somewhat bulbous conical hat stands high off her head. The hat\u0026rsquo;s rim is rounded and protruding; it is engraved with short diagonal striations, creating a design resembling cable molding. On the proper left side of the hat, a graved line, interpreted here as a seam, runs from the apex to the rim.\nThe woman\u0026rsquo;s left forearm emerges from the cloak as it encircles the upper body of the child; her left hand lies flat on the child\u0026rsquo;s upper arm. The upright, frontally and rigidly posed child tilts back toward the body of the woman. From the back, it appears that the child is under the mantle of the adult. The child wears a miniature version of the adult\u0026rsquo;s garments, but the hood/collar section of the mantle is pulled over the head. The mantle fits snugly around the brow, curves behind the right ear, and drapes forward over the shoulder and chest before extending to the ankles. The tiny shod feet are set side by side and jut straight outward. Below them is a spur of amber. The child, too, appears to wear a long chiton.\nThe woman\u0026rsquo;s head is large, full, and round, and her neck thick, short, and cylindrical. The child\u0026rsquo;s neck is characteristically short, and the head is a smaller, more delicate, and slightly more schematic version of the adult\u0026rsquo;s. No hair is visible on either figure. Both the woman\u0026rsquo;s and the child\u0026rsquo;s eyes are blank, almond-shaped bosses, turned up slightly at the outer canthi (the right eye of each is slanted more sharply upward at the outer canthus than are the left eyes), and are surmounted by an eyebrow ridge that moves smoothly from the temples over the orbits. The eyes of both figures, set between a bulging brow and cheeks, are almost as big in profile as in full face, but the child\u0026rsquo;s eyes are less richly modeled than the woman\u0026rsquo;s, and the line separating the eye from the brow is longer. Both figures\u0026rsquo; brows are low and flat. The noses are short, smooth, and triangular, and the bar-shaped mouths are formed as horizontal protrusions. The chins are wide. Both figures have round, flat ears with an opening at the position of the tragus. The woman\u0026rsquo;s ears are placed close to the hat rim. The child\u0026rsquo;s right ear, a flatter version of the woman\u0026rsquo;s, is far back on the head.\nThe tilt of the woman\u0026rsquo;s head, the illogical location of her feet, the scale of the figures, the child\u0026rsquo;s placement, and the concave depression on the lower part of the woman all suggest that the sculptural configuration is dependent on the amber blank\u0026rsquo;s original shape.\nIn addition to the engraved grooves and lines, some traces of abrasion are visible on the woman\u0026rsquo;s neck and in the depression of the lower right section of the heavy cloak. Two perforations form a V-shaped suspension system, each extending from a hole drilled at the shoulder and meeting just below the position of the woman\u0026rsquo;s right wrist. The amber may have been strung with one carrier forming a loop. Alternatively, if there were two filaments, each could have been knotted at the point below the woman\u0026rsquo;s right wrist. In either case, the figures would have stood upright when suspended.\nDiscussion 77.AO.84 and Citation: 77.AO.85Cat. no. 2 (cat. no. 2) belong to the category of divinities known as child-carriers, or kourotrophoi, and are composed in the side-by-side pose exclusive to heroes and divinities, a schema of great antiquity.1\nFor the style and the forms, the principal amber comparisons for 77.AO.84 are a pendant in London of two standing figures2 and a group of four Etruscan amber pendants in Philadelphia, perhaps excavated at Ascoli Piceno.3 One of the latter pendants, MS 2536, a fragmentary standing woman, is the single best parallel for 77.AO.84 in style and physical type.\nThe physiognomies of the women and children of 77.AO.84, Citation: 77.AO.85Cat. no. 2, and the relevant Philadelphia pendant are characteristic of Orientalizing Etruscan sculpture. They all have long, almond-shaped eyes, named the Blind Eye by Emeline Richardson.4 In common with the Etruscan votive bronzes that Richardson groups together as Orientalizing Early Etruscan Ladies, the Getty Museum six and their amber comparanda exhibit the same solid, rounded Assyrian forms; in Richardson\u0026rsquo;s words, “the convex surfaces of the ‘Assyrian’ tradition as well as its convention of a fully draped figure and some of its massive quality.”5 The ambers, like the Ladies, were likely carved in northern Etruria.6 An excellent comparison for 77.AO.84 in the Ladies group is the small votive bronze of a woman in London (British Museum 1907.3–11.1), which Richardson points out is the earliest shoe-wearer and is closer to the “Assyrian” aesthetic than any other.7 She dates this figure to the end of the seventh century.\nWhile Volterra may have been the center of such production, specific details of dress and style among the ambers also draw them close to Chiusi. One example is a bronze in Leiden (Rijksmuseum van Oudheden H3 ZZZZ 1), said to have come from Montalcino (in the ancient Chiusine territory).8\nA large bronze from Brolio, which should be considered Chiusine, is another excellent parallel.9 The bronzes and ambers reveal several similarities, including a geometric structuring of the figures, their proportions—especially the smallness of the hands and feet in relation to the rest of the body—and the form of the faces, fingers, and thumbs.\nEach of the constituent parts of the dress worn by the woman of 77.AO.84—long chiton, cloak, boots, and hat—are Etruscan. Larissa Bonfante refers to the mantle, similar to those worn by 77.AO.84 and Citation: 77.AO.85Cat. no. 2, as a kind of cape “raincoat.”10 Richardson describes it as a distinctly Etruscan garment, names it the Heavy Cloak, and underlines its dependence on masculine Near Eastern models.11\nThe carver of 77.AO.84 indicated the important sartorial details of the Heavy Cloak, which must be based on an understanding of the actual garment. The collar/hood section of the cloak is formed by bunched fabric. The child\u0026rsquo;s cloak is drawn over its head, so no collar is formed. The line that extends from just below the armhole to the hem may represent a seam joining the garment\u0026rsquo;s front and back sections, but more likely it indicates the meeting or overlap of the selvages.\nUnder the cloak, the large 77.AO.84 figure wears a long chiton. Both male and female figures wear the “the Oriental, clinging, unbelted tunic,” as Sybille Haynes describes it.12 At the Archaic Building Complex at Poggio Civitate, tunic-wearers animate the terracotta frieze plaques,13 and two—one passenger in the two-wheeled cart (perhaps a woman) and the woman seated on the curved throne in the assembly of seated figures—also wear an enveloping cloak.\nThe tall hat of 77.AO.84 is distinct in its slightly bulging conical shape, in the manner in which it is worn (toward the front of the head and concealing all hair, front and back), and in its construction. Despite its simple form, the carver articulates specific details of its structure: the egglike bugle, the seam line on the front, the tiny dimple at the apex, and the rounded, upturned brim with diagonal striations. The form of the brim and the seam line indicate that the hat is of leather, skin (fur side inward), or leather lined with fur, and not of felt; the horizontal line likely indicates an upturn, and the diagonal lines, the whipstitching.14\nIt is rare to find representations of Etruscans wearing pointed hats before about the mid-sixth century, but afterward, various kinds of conical hats—originally a male fashion in the Near East—appear everywhere, in innumerable variations of type, size, and even number worn at the same time.15 Conical hats were a female fashion in Etruria. (They are related to but not identical with the pointed hat worn only by haruspices.) The hat of 77.AO.84 stands out as unusual within the repertoire of Etruscan pointed headgear and dates to the moment just before the fashion took off in Etruria. The combination of its bulbous shape, construction, and placement on the head sets it apart from later-fashionable types. The Oriental masculine contemporary parallels include the hats of “Asian” figures represented in Egyptian relief sculpture, as well as the hats worn by some Cypriot priests and some divinities on Phoenician engraved gems. Antecedents are found in Hittite and other North Syrian sculpture. The bulbous shape is like that of the traditional crown of Upper Egypt. Oriental precedents for female figures wearing cone-shaped hats are few but significant, and among them are an image of a Hittite goddess in a pointed hat on a silver rhyton16 and the hats of Near Eastern lamassu, the beneficent protective female deities first seen in the Neo-Sumerian period. Contemporary and just slightly earlier Greek parallels for females wearing this distinctive hat type are to be found in Magna Graecia and Laconia. Many of the sixth-century terracottas of Artemis excavated at the Metapontine spring sanctuary of San Biagio wear nearly identical hats. As Gesche Olbrich has argued,17 the San Biagio type is closely related to the Tarantine Artemis and Artemis Bendis types of terracottas; and the Artemis of the San Biagio sanctuary is closely related to the Laconian Artemis Orthia, who herself has important connections to the Near East and the Minoan-Mycenaean worlds.\nCarved amber figures with pointed hats are few, and in each case, they differ from the type and personage of 77.AO.84. The female figure of the New York “Morgan Amber” (introduction, figure 24), the bow of a fibula,18 wears a hat with one seam near the midfront and a large, flat upturn. It is set back on the head, and the front of the hair shows. Two of the wingless flying figures from Sala Consilina in the Petit Palais are hatted. The bee divinity (perhaps Ideo with Zeus) sports a pointed, beanielike hat with six seams and a dog-toothed turnup; the vessel-carrier wears a swirl-wrapped hat with a simple upturn.19 Other amber figures in pointed hats include numerous female pendants (Etruscan and Italic, late sixth to early fourth centuries), but these usually display small, close-fitting, pointed caps, which are sometimes worn under veils and over garments.\nOther important Etruscan parallels for the hat of 77.AO.84 are a unique pair of hats depicted in the Tomb of the Funeral Couch, where they are placed on an ornate bed,20 and the hats worn by certain bronze figures. Six Middle Archaic draped bronze female figures, four winged and two wingless, were part of a wheeled vehicle (a carpentum, or mule-drawn cart) found at Castel San Mariano near Corciano (Perugia).21 Another example is a Late Archaic bronze, a rare type of votive kore, from Volterra.22 The figure (she must be a divinity) on the apex of a large bronze kyathos handle from Bisenzio, of the late sixth century, holds a small raptor.23 She and the Potnia Theron of the bronze appliqué are the only ones to hold birds.\nThe hats of the four Middle Archaic winged bronzes (representing Turan, an unnamed divinity, or possibly a protective genius) and of the Volterran Late Archaic figure are more elaborate than that of 77.AO.84. Their head coverings are either wrappings of long ribbons of cloth or wrapped hats.24 The hats worn by the Middle Archaic bronze korai are the best parallels for the pitch of the hat, the form of the crown, the thick, rolled rim, and the lack of visible hair on 77.AO.84. In comparison, the cart attachments wear their hair long and unbound, and the Volterran figure wears hers tucked up inside the hat (it is just visible beneath the rim in front and back).\nAlthough there are numerous illustrations in Etruscan art of women wearing tunics, heavy cloaks, or boots, there does not seem to be any other figure wearing this combination. The nearest relative is the uniquely dressed Etruscan votive bronze of a woman from Brolio in Florence (Museo Archeologico Nazionale 561), dating to the late sixth to early fifth centuries, already mentioned above for its Chiusine style.25 Instead of a tunic, Florence 561 wears an old-fashioned long Ionian chiton, along with boots, a pointed hat, and a cloak (which is pulled up over the hat). Florence 561 must represent a divinity.\nNot only is the dress of 77.AO.84 unusual, so is its subject. There are only three other kourotrophoi of amber known to this author, and all are Etruscan. These include Citation: 77.AO.85Cat. no. 2, a kourotrophos in a London private collection that must date to the mid-seventh century,26 and a tiny amber kourotrophos in the Metropolitan Museum of Art that is strongly Ionian in style, very like a number of Chiusine bronzes, and of fifth-century date.27 Each of the four amber kourotrophoi holds the child on the left side; otherwise, they differ from one another in details of pose, dress, and style.\nKourotrophoi have an ancient history in and around the Mediterranean.28 Without other specific information, such as an inscription or burial context, the images of women, or nurses, holding children cannot be associated with any one divinity or function. 77.AO.84 may represent “any of the multifarious lists of mythical mothers and nurses who were so popular, and often venerated, in early Italy.”29 Although the amber figure\u0026rsquo;s hat brings the figure close to the Metapontine terracottas of Artemis with the pointed hat, there are no examples of the hatted variety as a kourotrophos.30 The child, who can be interpreted as standing upright, may specifically allude to the Greek Artemis. Artemis could cause deformities in children, particularly of the foot or leg; conversely, she could be called upon to protect the child from such deformities. That the child is held up and represented as well formed could be read as emphasizing the divinity\u0026rsquo;s protective role.31\nAlternatively, it is possible that the adult figure of 77.AO.84 represents a divinity similar to the Latin Mater Matuta. The solar aspects of amber would make it an attractive material for such an image. Matronae prayed to this goddess of light and childbirth and presented to her, not their own child, but their sisters.’32 The exceptional figured ambers from (the priestess\u0026rsquo;s) Tomb VI at Satricum, where the Mater Matuta was worshiped, lend weight to this hypothesis.\nWhatever the identity of 77.AO.84, her pose and the child are significant. Her right hand is placed on her breast, atop the cloak opening. The gesture of 77.AO.84 is the same one made by the two figures of Citation: 77.AO.81.1Cat. no. 3 (cat. no. 3) and perhaps by the adult figure of Citation: 77.AO.85Cat. no. 2. It is of great antiquity and is found on many contemporary images, including a considerable number of Early Etruscan sculpted works. It has been variously read, resulting in correspondingly varying interpretations of the figures making it—and vice versa. The gesture makers have been identified as divinities, priestesses, votives, supplicants, adorants, adherents, and mourners.33 Although most scholars agree that the hand-on-breast gesture is Oriental in origin, there is less consensus about its meaning. It has been interpreted as a sign of thanksgiving (signifying gratitude to a deity for a favor conferred), as a sign of adoration or of offering, and as one of mourning. Some have seen it as one variant in a system of female gestures that call attention to the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics.34 In his discussion of the marble Dame d\u0026rsquo;Auxerre (Musée du Louvre), who also makes this gesture, Jean-Luc Martinez is cautious in assigning a precise signification, in particular a funerary one, to the sculpture.35\nFor Etruscan sculpture in small and large scale, Bonfante regards the gesture as one of mourning.36 If the figures are indeed mourners, the gesture would support the thesis of a funerary role for the pendant. However, if the figures are ancestors (including heroes) or divinities, identifying the gesture as funerary is a less sustainable conclusion. Almost every known Etruscan figure making the “hand on breast with thumb up” gesture has come from a tomb, and it could be argued that some represent divinities. Notable examples are the seventh-century stone Figure A from Casale Marittimo;37 a number of early bucchero caryatid figures;38 the early-sixth-century bronze female divinity from the Vulcian Polledrara cemetery “Isis Tomb”;39 one of the limestone figures from the Pietrera tumulus;40 the woman atop the much-restored Chiusine “Paolozzi urn”;41 several of the stone female divinities from Chiusi; and a number of the Chiusine enthroned “canopus” figures of young men. Bonfante notes the pose of a figure on a gold plaque from Rhodes.42 A comparable right-hand gesture is made by some East Greek plastic vases in the form of a female bust; it is also made by some of the Artemis Metapontine terracotta figures from the San Biagio sanctuary, representations Gesche Olbrich considers to be of the goddess herself, not votives.43\nThe pose of 77.AO.84—the position of the body, head, arms, and hands—gains from being read as one movement in a sequence “frozen” at its most characteristic point. This is the case with many Egyptian images, as R. H. Wilkinson explains: “Sequential gestures exist where a certain pose or gesture occurs within a sequence of continuous action.… The specific gesture usually illustrated was perhaps chosen because it represented the most important or recognizable part of [a complex] ceremony, but it must be remembered that gesture can only be understood in terms of the meaning of the larger ritual in which it was embedded.”44 If this is the case with 77.AO.84, then it may be that pose is one that incorporates a fertility gesture and is at the same time one of promise: The divinity avows the deceased the gift of rebirth, the activity of the left hand that of carrying the child and that of the right, avowal. That the object was ultimately funerary may have modified or even added to the pose\u0026rsquo;s meaning.\nThis glittering, large ornament was a potent amulet, the subject of which could place the wearer under the divinity\u0026rsquo;s protection. As such, it joins many of the earliest images of females in world art, which are small in scale and functioned magically, many as protection. Amulets in the form of a standing female figure, often suckling a child, were popular in Egypt as early as the New Kingdom.45 In the ancient Near East, amulets of seated female figures occur as early as the eighth millennium.46 A third-millennium fertility goddess from Cyprus wears a miniature of her own image.47\nThe figural groups are all carved fully in the round and well secured by the system of attachment for suspension. Were the pendants intended to swing freely? Were they an attachment to clothing, a larger ornament, or even a structure? Were they used in life or only for the rituals of death, and thereafter in the tomb? Who made the ambers, following which models or according to which recipes?\nWho placed them with the deceased? Whoever was buried with the ambers, and whoever saw to it that these ambers accompanied the deceased, must have had the appropriate knowledge and status. If the original owner was the deceased, might the owner have been a ritual political-religious specialist? Were 77.AO.84 and the other ambers part of her ceremonial properties? On the other hand, might these fabulous figured ambers have been grave gifts, even insignia, of another ritual political-religious specialist? Whatever the answers, something similar must also be the case for the amber ensemble from Tomb VI at Satricum.48\nNotes   Citation: Richardson 1983Richardson, E. H.

Etruscan Votive Bronzes: Geometric, Orientalizing, Archaic. 2 vols. Mainz am Rhein, 1983., p. 32, n. 41, is one of the oldest examples of a woman wearing the pointed hat, and some of Richardson\u0026rsquo;s Early Etruscan Ladies (pp. 49–51) wear a small pointed hat under the veil. Some Late Archaic bronzes wear small conical hats stacked one atop another.\nThe Assyrian conical hat is constructed from a soft material, so that it does not stand up, and its crown is creased, with a sagging tip. This is more than likely a felt hat, as are the hats worn by a number of (possibly hairless) elite male figures engaged in various ceremonial activities (perhaps including augury) on a number of bronze situlas, such as one found at Vaće, Slovenia (Narodni muzej Ljubljana P581), and another excavated at Magdalenska gora near Smarje, Slovenia (Narodni muzej Ljubljana P4281). These are soft, pointed hats with rolled rims articulated with diagonal lines.\nA pointed-hat type common to Cypriot Archaic figures is almost identical to the “bonnets” worn by the later-fourth-century bambino in fasce votives from the Capua region.

The goddess holds a falcon (possibly) in her left hand, a cup in her right. Her tall, seamed hat has a diagonally striated turnup; the horns (or perhaps uraeus) are represented in profile. ↩ Citation: Olbrich 1979Olbrich, G.

Rome, 1979., chap. 4, distinguishes the type found on many of the Metapontine terracottas of Artemis (always worn over long, flowing hair) from that of the Etruscan tutulus and points out its parallels at Samos, Cyprus, Rhodes, Assos (Troas), Sicily, Etruria, Lucania, and Apulia, and Magna Graecia (Taranto and Metaponto-Pisticci). She also charts the relationship between the hat of the San Biagio terracottas and the Phrygian hat of the Artemis Bendis type. ↩ New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art 17.191.2067, Gift of J.

Abundance of Life: Etruscan Wall Painting from the Geometric Period to the Hellenistic Period. Trans. R. Stockman. Los Angeles, 2006., p. 139, presents the space as a festival tent or baldachin on posts, “dominated by a large empty bed reminiscent of a catafalque, with two light shrouds, two pillows, two wreaths, and two conical caps resembling the pilos caps of the Dioscuri.” Represented is either a deceased aristocratic couple or the divine duo. If the latter is the case, Steingräber believes the representation to be a theoxenia or a lectisternium, and the hats then represent the divinities aniconically. However, compare Citation: Haynes 2000Haynes, S. Etruscan Civilization: A Cultural History. Los Angeles, 2000., p. 237: she suggests that the two hats may be funerary cippi.

Le stele della Daunia. Milan, 1988.. ↩ The Middle Archaic bronzes are distributed between Perugia and Munich. A recent proposal for the placement of the winged figures on the four corners of the box of a carpentum in the reconstruction by S.

Paraphrasing Richardson, the figure wears a properly understood Ionian chiton, a rarity among Etruscan korai, a dress that illustrates a drapery style of some competence, contrasting with her “thoroughly un-Greek” heavy, round head, ugly ears, and broad, smiling face. Hair peeks out from under the hat brim in front and back. The conical hat has a similar turned-up rim with diagonal markings and is wrapped (clockwise) with a long strip of cloth in a pattern distinct from that of the above-mentioned Middle Archaic korai. Richardson singles out the Munich kore as one of the finest of the Mannerist korai, as well as being the biggest. Her unparalleled costume, a mixture of Ionian and Etruscan fashion, her pose, and her (perhaps) youthful proportions of large head and smaller body, characterized by a rather planklike modeling, also set the kore apart. Might the Munich bronze be an updated reflection of an early statue, or phenotype, of Artemis?\nThe face of the adult figure is very like that of two sculptures in the British Museum, a bronze statue of a woman from the Polledrara cemetery “Isis Tomb” who holds a horned bird (GR 1850.2–27.15), as well as a gypsum statue of a woman said to be from the same tomb (GR 1850.2–27.1). As is the case for 77.AO.84 and the other five ambers, the gypsum statue shows the influence of Greek prototypes, particularly from Crete and the Peloponnese as well as from Phoenicia and the Near East.

Roncalli\u0026rsquo;s theoretical reconstruction of the bust is untenable.\n↩ Florence, Museo Nazionale Archeologico 74913. The standing (perhaps) figure on the apex of the kyathos handle wears a conically shaped hat under a veil, a chiton, and boots, and holds what looks like a small raptor on her right hand. G. C.

(Ino/Leokothea\u0026rsquo;s role as the young Dionysos\u0026rsquo;s nurse probably gave her the character of a protectress of small children.) On Leukothea, see I.

At 3.128, Artemis is called out for inflicting her grievous anger when she causes wives “to give birth to children of whom none stands on upright ankle.” The Getty kourotrophos pendants, thus interpreted, could be amulets of the “frightening-the-demons” type. Here, too, the apotropaic nature of amber reinforces the subject. Although she writes of objects of a later period, Stephanie Leitch\u0026rsquo;s explanation is relevant: “Demons can see and the pagan prescriptions for avoiding evil, most notably, were prescriptions that were activated through sight and seeing … among the methods chosen for foiling an evil force was the use of a bright and dazzling object” to distract it from its intended victim: S.

Paul Getty Museum, 1977.\nCondition The pendant is in good condition, with a firm, smooth, stable surface. Before its entry into the Getty Museum, the two broken sections of the pendant were reattached and a synthetic fill was added to the break that runs along the left contour below the feet of the smaller figure. There are additional small chips on the reverse along the break and on the boot toes of the larger figure. There are visible inclusions in the fissure at the center, between the two figures, and in the midsections of each figure. The back surface and much of the front are covered with a dusty, light yellow ocher layer of degraded amber. In ambient light, the piece is reddish brown with some translucent areas; in transmitted light, the object is translucent and ruby red.\nDescription The pendant is conceived fully in the round and is composed of two frontal figures in a side-by-side pose, with a long-necked waterbird at the lower right. The human figures are identified as a woman and child because of their proportions, morphological (facial) features, dress, hair, and form of the upper torsos. The woman extends the full length of the amber and fills approximately one half of the composition. The child is carved into the upper section of the other half; beneath its feet is a spur of amber, which might be read as a groundline. Below the child, at the bottom, is the bird. It stands on the same plane as the woman. Since the bird is represented only on the obverse and the triangular depression above its head is inside the garment, it should be read as standing within the shelter of the woman\u0026rsquo;s outer garment.\nDespite the difference in scale between the figures and in some of the details, both share the same head-to-body proportion, as well as dress and hairstyle. Their facial characteristics are comparably fashioned (even if they are not identical): the forehead, eyebrow ridge, temple region, and nose are conceived as a single modeled unit composed of a continuous curving form from the top edges of the head to the end of the nose. The slightly bulging, almond-shaped blank eyes are fitted neatly beneath the eyebrow ridge, the outer canthi higher than the inner ones, and the right eyes slanted higher at the outer canthi. Their noses are long and narrow (that of the woman is slightly wider), with delicate nostrils. The mouths are wider than the noses. The lips curve into slight smiles; the lower lips are slightly wider than the upper. The cheeks and lower faces are wide and rounded. The chins are short; in profile, they protrude to the level of the root of the nose. While the two faces are very similar, there are minor differences between them. The child\u0026rsquo;s face is finer in structure, her features smaller, and her chin more pointed. There is a distinct nasolabial line on the woman\u0026rsquo;s face; there is none on the child\u0026rsquo;s.\nBoth figures wear a similar undergarment. There is no neck detail; the garment is indicated only by the hem and lower section of a long skirt. Both also wear close-fitting veils over their heads. The front of the hair is just visible at the brow. The woman\u0026rsquo;s left frontal hair lock descends from her temples to just below her breasts; the child\u0026rsquo;s (on her right side) ends at the shoulder. The same heavy outer garment covers both figures. The line parallel to the front edge of the mantles may be a turnback or fold of the cloak; alternatively, it may represent the seam closing the lower edge of the sleeve. With her left arm and hand, the woman encircles the child; she places her right hand on her own chest. The tear-shaped form emerging from the border of the cloak may be the top of her thumb, although it is very large. Alternatively, it might represent the tip of a lotus blossom. The child\u0026rsquo;s arms are not visible. The woman is barefooted: four toes and the instep are delineated. There is no elaboration of the child\u0026rsquo;s feet. The plump bird\u0026rsquo;s body and legs are in a resting pose (the feet are visible), the neck is stretched back, with the head reverted, and the right wing is raised.\nAs is the case for all of the amber objects in this group, the original form of the amber blank appears to have played a key role in the composition. The nodule\u0026rsquo;s shape is suggested by the placement, size, and stance of the figures, and by the depressed area between the adult and child.\nThere are small drill holes in the corners of each figure\u0026rsquo;s mouth. Abrasion marks are visible underneath the chins, along the left body contour, around the head and neck of the bird, and between the feet of the adult. There are engraved lines around the eyes, separating the lips, along the front edges of the mantles, and in the hair plaits. The single perforation has two holes, one exit between the two heads at the position of the ears, and the second exit in the indentation between the two heads. The pendant probably was suspended from a strand or strands knotted at the base of the lower hole so that the piece hung as if the figures were standing.\nDiscussion There is no exact parallel for this pendant. In style, 77.AO.85 is very like others in the Getty group; it shares comparisons with them and is equally complex in its relationship to contemporary and earlier art, with Greek (Cretan, Ionian, and Peloponnesian), Cypriot, and Near Eastern objects. The subject, like that of Citation: 77.AO.84Cat. no. 1 (cat. no. 1), is a kourotrophic divinity. The iconography is underlined by the compositional format and the chosen material, amber. The dress and the hairstyles of the two figures identify them as female. The smaller figure likely represents a child rather than an infant since it is “standing on upright ankle.”1 The active pose of the goose contrasts with the stillness of the human figures. Because the adult and child are frontal, standing, and stationary (and the adult wingless), it is unlikely that an abduction scene is represented.2\nThe bird of 77.AO.85 is schematic but telling. The carver indicated some salient features that suggest that a particular species is represented: the round head, long, undercurved bill, and distinctive form of the tail feathers aid in identifying the fowl as a white-fronted goose.3\nThere are many similarities between this pendant and the Female Holding a Child (Kourotrophos) ( Citation: 77.AO.84Cat. no. 1), presented above. There are also differences in the pose, hairstyle, and manner of covering the heads. Only 77.AO.85 includes a bird. The woman of Citation: 77.AO.84Cat. no. 1 is hatted, no hair is showing, and the hood section of her mantle is down. No hair shows on the child, and it is wrapped in a mantle. Both figures are shod. In contrast, both figures of 77.AO.85 have their heads covered by a common mantle, show hair at the brow, and wear temple locks. The woman of 77.AO.85 is barefooted. No long chiton or other undergarment is delineated for the figures of Citation: 77.AO.84Cat. no. 1, yet in this pendant, the bottom hem of the undergarment is shown. If the protrusion emerging in the area of the chest from the front closure of the cloak of 77.AO.85 is a thumb, and the hand is thus flattened on the breast, the gesture is similar to that of Citation: 77.AO.84Cat. no. 1 and to both women of the Addorsed Females pendant ( Citation: 77.AO.81.1Cat. no. 3, cat. no. 3). As discussed above in the entry for Citation: 77.AO.84Cat. no. 1, this hand gesture has been variously interpreted. It is likely one with complex meanings, but it certainly had a fertility aspect and perhaps a funerary one. Avowal or promise also may be inherent. On the other hand, the droplike shape could represent the tip of an unopened lotus blossom, a subject of great antiquity in ancient art and a symbol of youth, fertility, and rebirth. The lotus blossom may have been thought especially apt for an unfurled young life, as it was in Egypt.4\nThe type of undergarment worn by each figure of 77.AO.85 cannot be determined, since only the hem and lower edge of a skirt are indicated. There is no articulation at the neck. This might suggest that the carver neglected these aspects of dress or that the figures of 77.AO.85 wear skirts only beneath their mantles. If this is the case, one possible parallel is the bronze divinity from the Vulcian “Isis” Tomb, whose only garment may be a skirt.5\nAmber comparisons for 77.AO.85 include the other five in the Getty group and two others in London and Philadelphia, an unprovenanced pendant in the form of two standing figures in the British Museum,6 and a pendant in the form of a female figure, possibly from Ascoli Piceno, in Philadelphia (University of Pennsylvania, Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology).7 An ivory carving of a seated female figure, part of a furnishing from Pianello di Castelbellino, has the distinctive short neck, short-set body, and facial profile of the ambers.8\nFor the figures of 77.AO.85, the best comparisons among Etruscan small bronzes are found in Emeline Richardson\u0026rsquo;s Early Etruscan Ladies, Series B, Group 1,9 the same group that helps to situate Citation: 77.AO.84Cat. no. 1 and Citation: 77.AO.81.1Cat. no. 3. Bronzes in Florence (Museo Archeologico Nazionale 225) and London (British Museum 1907.3–11.1) are particularly relevant for their body proportions, facial features, and overall combination of dress elements. Florence, Museo Archeologico Nazionale 27, and Leiden, Rijksmuseum van Oudheden H3 ZZZZ 1, provide the best parallels for the cloak of 77.AO.85. The “Etruscan-ness” of 77.AO.85 and the related ambers and bronzes is brought out further when they are compared to large-scale Etruscan figures. They share with the gypsum figure in London (from the Polledrara Cemetery at Vulci), the pair of limestone figures from Casale Marittimo, and some early Chiusine limestone figures a solidity and retention of the permanent materials in the sculptures.10\nPotnia Theron figures stamped on a number of bucchero kyathos handles—two excavated at Poggio Civitate and others likely from Chiusi11—are important comparisons, not only for composition and style, but also for specific features such as the birds and the figure\u0026rsquo;s temple locks. As L. Bonfante has outlined, the Greek-influenced Etruscan fashioning of temple locks was popular from the end of the seventh through the first half of the sixth centuries.12 Comparable temple locks are worn by some funerary female busts from Chiusi, by the bronze divinity from the Vulcian “Polledrara Tomb” or “Isis Tomb,” and by the standing female bronze from the Brolio deposit.13 The amber figures\u0026rsquo; locks are most like the latter\u0026rsquo;s.\nNot only might the hairstyle be Greek-derived, so too might aspects of the style and iconography. Both Peloponnesian and South Ionian stylistic aspects of 77.AO.85—and of the Divinity Holding Hares ( Citation: 77.AO.82Cat. no. 4, cat. no. 4), and the other Kourotrophos ( Citation: 77.AO.84Cat. no. 1)—are brought out by comparison to certain Arcadian and Sicyonian bronzes of Hermes Kriophoros and of other unnamed shepherds.14 The ambers and bronzes have a related solidity of sculptural forms and similar modeling of the bodies beneath the dress and relative proportions (head-to-body and torso-to-leg length); they also all have thin arms and small hands and feet. (The small hands and small feet are also characteristic of the four largest figures from the Brolio find, the bronze statuettes of a female and three warrior males.) The backs of 77.AO.85 and Citation: 77.AO.82Cat. no. 4 are especially like those of the Peloponnesian bronzes. A comparison to the Man in Cloak in Providence, to cite one example, is telling.15\nThe South Ionian aspect is apparent when the ambers are compared to the most “Samian” of Etruscan bronzes. For instance, the “Kneeling Archer” in Providence16 is akin in facial details, general physical type, sculptural proportions, and smooth modeling. The South Ionian aspects of the amber pendants are elicited by comparison to an ivory of a horse-tamer and to a wood sculpture of two figures, both thought to be Samian.17 Alfonsina Russo suggests the existence of an Ionian, specifically Samian-influenced, amber carving atelier in the Metaponto area, with two examples: the seated amber figure from a grave at Tolve and another from Tomb 122 at the Rutigliano-Purgatorio necropolis.18\nThe common mantle and the goose may be iconographic details that help one to interpret the meaning and functions of 77.AO.85. The mantle shelters the figures beneath it and separates them from the outside: it can serve both literally and figuratively as a sign of protection.19 The common mantle can be interpreted as an ancient fertility motif, a signifier of matrilineal descent, a symbol of marriage and procreation, and more simply as a protective device.\nHow does the goose function in this pendant? Is it a symbol or attribute, or does it perform some temporal or narrative role? Long-necked birds are among the earliest sculpted objects: one of the earliest is the ducklike (perhaps) bird, seen in profile, from Uruk, of about 3000 B.C.20 In Egypt the goose is one of the forms of the solar god Atum. Early in Etruscan art, in illustrations of both landscape and the built environment, waterfowl are in residence, and they are represented as resting, standing, or in action. Birds, especially waterfowl, feature prominently on the bronze objects from Iron Age Italy. Ducks, geese, and swans are among the most numerous subjects of figured ambers found at sites in Greece, Etruria, and Latium.21 Long-necked and short-legged waterfowl may be the most frequent of all faunal decoration in earliest Etruscan imagery, embellishing countless objects found in tombs. Images of female divinities with waterfowl, usually in the schema of the goddess known as Potnia Theron, are found on bronzes, including vessels and ornaments, as early as the eighth century B.C.\nEarly Etruscan sculptural images of divinities, male or female, defined by attributes are relatively rare, and it is significant that among them are goddesses with birds, mainly waterfowl and raptors. Among the sculptured representations are the early-sixth-century bronze divinity with a horned bird from the Vulcian “Polledrara Tomb,” or “Isis Tomb,” and a slightly later freestanding bronze statuette in Cortona with a large bird of prey (perhaps an eagle) perched on her head.22 The latter is comparable to the Laconian (or possibly Tarentine) divinity that forms the handle of a bronze hydria of about 570 found at Grächwil, Switzerland.23 Female divinities with birds are to be found in Etruscan bucchero, painted vases, and gold objects of adornment (namely earrings, pendants, and plaques). Many are in the Potnia Theron schema and some are represented in the bird-atop-the-head pose.24 Divinities with birds (again both waterbirds and raptors) on contemporary Greek vases (primarily Corinthian and Laconian) and on a series of ivory plaques from the Spartan sanctuary of Artemis Orthia include depictions of both schemata.25 An Etruscan mirror support of fifth-century date is a later relevant example: it represents an old-fashioned kore figure wearing what appears to be a pointed hat with an upturned rim.26 The join to the mirror is in the form of addorsed, upside-down swans.\nAbove are listed the images of female divinities with birds. With the possible exception of the lion- or hare-wielding Mistresses of the Animals, no other divinities as such are represented with animals or birds. The only other example of a kourotrophos with a bird known to me is a much later type of Etrusco-Latial terracotta votive statue from Satricum, of fourth- to second-century date. In these terracottas the woman is seated, the child is in her lap, and a bird is standing in front. B. M. Fridh-Haneson posits that this and related multifigured, single-mantled terracotta votives are Orphic-Dionysiac, and that they represent rebirth to eternal life by divine adoption, a hoped-for assimilation and identification with Dionysos.27\nWhat roles are played by the bird of 77.AO.85? Might the fowl act as an attribute, signify the location of the figure\u0026rsquo;s divine actions, or point to a specific activity? After all, the bird is in action, in contrast to the static pose of the figures. Might the goose signify transit and rebirth28 or designate the figure as the Greek Artemis? It is perhaps not a native Italian divinity, such as the Etruscan Artumes (or Artames or Aritimi), who “never became mistress of the wild animals or even goddess of the hunt, as she had been in Greece.”29\nThe elaborate perforation system of the pendant, which when strung would have maintained the upright posture of the figures, strongly suggests that 77.AO.85 was suspended or worn or was attached to something before its ultimate burial. As a shining ornament, 77.AO.85 was a large, glittering jewel figured with potent imagery. As a permanent amulet, it could have been considered as theomorphic, one that would have offered its wearer, on earth, in the tomb, or in the afterworld, the protection of the deity represented. Both material and subjects were the province of persons of elevated social rank, members of the religious and political elite. In life, its owner could have shown herself to be a votive of the divinity represented: the combination of material and subject would have played a powerful danger-averting and protective role. In the tomb, 77.AO.85 might offer special protection and even guidance to the deceased in the fraught voyage to the afterworld.\nNotes   See cat. no. 1, n. 35. ↩ For a recent discussion of images of pursuit and abduction in Etruscan art and the possible ambiguities of meaning, see A.

Birds on Aegean Bronze Age Seals: A Study of Representation. Rovaniemi, Finland, 1992.. Douglas Causey (pers. comm.) corroborates the identification of the image as that of a white-fronted goose.

Warminster, 1986., p. 57. In ancient Egypt, the standard hieroglyphic sign for a goose is generally taken to represent this species. In captivity, they are a sociable and peaceful bird and thus would have been an excellent goose to domesticate, unlike some other species. Then as now in Egypt, the white-fronted goose is a delicacy, and it appears that ancient Egyptians looked upon it as one of the more desirable table geese (Citation: Houlihan 1986Houlihan, P. F.

Tanaquil understood the actions of raptors. She, “like most Etruscans, was expert in interpreting celestial prodigies and delighted at the omen” of an eagle snatching and replacing her husband\u0026rsquo;s cap as they entered Rome, presaging his own, the Tarquins,’ and Etruria\u0026rsquo;s future, as related by Livy (1.34ff).\n↩ For the hydria from Grächwil (Bern, Historisches Museum 11620), see Die Hydria von Grächwil: Zur Funktion und Rezeption mediterraner Importe in Mitteleuropa im 6. und 5.

Belfer Philanthropic Fund Foundation, Patti Cadby Birch, and The Joseph Rosen Foundation Inc. Gifts, and Harris Brisbane Dick Fund, 1992). A significant parallel is the late-sixth-century necklace from Vulci (possibly); its nine pendants, made from sheet gold, are in the form of a crowned and necklaced bust of a female divinity with a resting duck on her head (Rome, Museo Nazionale Etrusco di Villa Giulia 53486): A. M. Moretti Sgubini, ed., La Collezione Augusto Castellani (Rome, 2000), pp. 180–81, no. 134, with references to comparanda in Hamburg and Munich. The bucchero oinochoe in Florence (Museo Archeologico Nazionale 3179), from Chiusi, may be another representation of the same divinity. The neck of the vase is made into the lower part of her head, the lid into a bird-topped hat; see World of the Etruscans 2001, pp. 28, 29, 95, no. 180. The handle of an unparalleled large bronze kyathos from Bisenzio (Florence, Museo Archeologico Nazionale 74913), of the later sixth century, has three figures represented on it, two different walking and greeting figures on each side of the handle, and a third at the apex, whose position is difficult to understand: she may be interpreted as supported by one figure on the inside of the handle (whose eyes are cast downward) or as seated at the apex of the handle. The divinity (for so must she be) wears a conically shaped hat under a veil, a chiton, and boots, and holds what looks like a small raptor on her right hand; see World of the Etruscans 2001, pp. 26, 91, no. 165. ↩ Canby 2002 (see n. 22, above); and Citation: Marangou 1969Marangou, L.

Paul Getty Museum, 1977.\nCondition The pendant is intact and in good condition. Although its two sides mirror each other, the obverse is distinguished by a more plastic rendering of the figures and superior carving, especially of the left-hand figure (hereafter referred to as Figure A). Figure A has minor chips on the reverse shoulder and small breaks on the feet at the hem area. Figure B has a chip on the reverse shoulder. The piece is a dark reddish brown color in ambient light and is dark ruby-red in transmitted light. There are many large inclusions, including those at the heads, torsos, knees, and feet of both figures.\nDescription The pendant is carved from a relatively flat piece of amber and represents two figures standing back to back. An indentation and an engraved line separate the rigidly posed, profiled figures. The two figures are identified as females because of their facial characteristics and dress. Although similar, they are not identical: the faces are especially idiosyncratic.\nOn both sides of Figure A, the forehead-to-nose line is smooth, with only the slightest bulge at the brow ridge and a faint indentation for the root of the nose. The eyes are amygdaloidal, with the outer corners higher than the inner. The angle of the nose is close to the facial plane; the nose itself points slightly downward, and overhangs the level of the short chin. The upper lip area is short; the upper lip protrudes over the lower. The face of B is different: the forehead slopes more acutely; the root of the nose is more deeply indented; the nose is attached lower on the face; and the angle of the nose is farther from the facial plane. The eyes of Figure B are also almond-shaped but are narrower. The figure\u0026rsquo;s lips have an even profile. Her chin is short and small, and there is a hint of a double chin. The mouth furrow, cheek modeling, and the area under the chin area are features that make Figure B appear older than A.\nThe two wear the same type of dress, a long chiton that descends to the ankle; a tightly fitting veil, which covers the hair and falls to the hem; and a heavy, ankle-length cloak. There is no indication of hair on either woman. Swellings and indentations on the surface of the piece describe the shape of the arms and upper torsos. Each figure places one hand flush on the chest and with the other holds the left edge of her garment at the waist area. Figure A has her right hand up and the left below; Figure B has her left hand above and the right below. The small feet of Figure B are pointed, without any toes delineated, suggesting that both figures were meant to be represented as shod. (The toe area of Figure A is broken off.)\nTool marks include visible abrasion traces in the sections closest to the engraved line that separates the two figures, at the necks, and at the ankles. The perforation for suspension passes from front to back at the center of the pendant, at the nape of each figure\u0026rsquo;s neck.\nDiscussion This amber pendant is unique in composition and iconography. The combination of dress elements worn by the figures of 77.AO.81.1—the long chiton, veil, and heavy, enveloping overgarment, Emeline Richardson\u0026rsquo;s Heavy Cloak—is otherwise unattested. Generally, the best parallels for the figures of 77.AO.81.1 are the two other pendants from this group with standing female figures— Citation: 77.AO.84Cat. no. 1 (cat. no. 1) and Citation: 77.AO.85Cat. no. 2 (cat. no. 2)—and their comparanda, including the group of four ambers likely from Ascoli Piceno in Philadelphia (University of Pennsylvania, Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology)1 and the pendant of two standing figures in London.2 The female figure in the latter, also presented in profile, is especially close in physical type and dress, although she is of a huskier physical type. 77.AO.81.1 also has correspondences with three other kinds of archaeological material: Etruscan bronzes, ivory and bone carvings, and bucchero ware. In each case, the traditions informing the imagery are similar.\nThe votive bronzes most like 77.AO.81.1 are in Richardson\u0026rsquo;s Early Etruscan Ladies Series,3 the same group that provides good parallels for Citation: 77.AO.82Cat. no. 4 (cat. no. 4) , Citation: 77.AO.84Cat. no. 1, and Citation: 77.AO.85Cat. no. 2. Three, now in London, Leiden, and Florence, respectively, are the most similar.4 The salient parallel for 77.AO.81.1 is the last, Florence 27, which is the latest in Richardson\u0026rsquo;s B Series. The sculptural contours and facial profiles are nearly identical, and, in both cases, the shawl curves over the forehead in the same way. The small feet are also comparable, although the Florence bronze wears calceoli repandi (curled-toe boots)5 rather than the simple boots of the amber women. London 1907.3–11.1, among the earliest in the Ladies Series, is most like the figures of 77.AO.81.1 in facial type, in the small, articulated hands, and in the shod feet. The Leiden bronze is most similar in dress. Although more simply rendered than on 77.AO.81.1, it is the same garment.6\nThe ivory and bone carvings related to 77.AO.81.1 include an identical pair of bone plaques from a chair or other furnishing from a tomb at Belmonte Piceno, representing a large winged goddess flanked by two small female figures;7 and a number of bone pendants, one from the Large Building excavations at Poggio Civitate,8 and others, all votives, from the Stipe di Sant\u0026rsquo;Omobono, Rome.9 The small figures from the Picene bone plaques wear clothing different from that of 77.AO.81.1 but are similar in their arm and hand positions and their addorsed poses. The unique figure-seal from the Sant\u0026rsquo;Omobono deposit is analogous in style and figural type but differs in the position of the arms. The arms of all of the Sant\u0026rsquo;Omobono votives (and probably that of the Poggio Civitate pendant) hang at their sides.\nThe images of Potnia Theron decorating the handles of some Orientalizing bucchero kyathoi are significantly similar in format and style to 77.AO.81.1. The figural type, proportions, and modeling are comparable to a series of kyathoi handles from Poggio Civitate,10 and to another type found at several sites, but which, too, may have originated at Chiusi. This type is adorned with images of a full-figured Potnia Theron who is winged and holds long-necked birds.11\nThere are few carved ambers formed into doubled subjects, but among them is another work from the same Getty group, Paired Lions ( Citation: 77.AO.81.3Cat. no. 6 (cat. no. 6) \u0026ldquo;,\u0026rdquo; \u0026gt;}}). Two other approximately contemporary examples, both Picene, are the fragmentary pendant with addorsed figures from Castelbellino12 and the Philadelphia pendant (MS 2358) in the form of a draped standing female backed with a nude figure.13 Earlier doubled-figure compositions in amber include the Getty Addorsed Sphinxes ( Citation: 78.AO.286.2Cat. no. 28, cat. no. 28) and a number of the pendants from Tomb VI at Satricum (circa 640–30 B.C.): two pairs of twinned nude females, a pair of twinned, possibly masked figures, a seated monkey with a small, fetuslike, possibly human figure on his head, and two pendants of conjoined foreparts, one a lion-centaur, and the other a lion and (perhaps) dog.14 Two parallels much later than 77.AO.81.1, dating to the fourth century, are pendants of addorsed human heads. One is the central pendant of a votive necklace from the sanctuary of the goddess Mefite in the Valle d\u0026rsquo;Ansanto (a rare example of a figured amber excavated from a sanctuary),15 and the second, a nearly identical pendant, also from a string of very similar-looking amber human-head pendants.16\nAddorsed compositions and doubling generally were already age-old by the sixth century. Doubled figures, some addorsed, are not uncommon among ivory and bone carvings from Egypt, the Near East, and the Phoenician world. This compositional motif was often used for objects such as handles17 and pommels as well as in weaving or embroidery. Doubled images may represent the same figure twice or two different figures. Doubling and twinning may always have been inherently magical. The doubling of a phrase in a magical spell was understood to increase its efficacy, and the same may have been true for imagery. In amulet making, doubling and addorsed compositions were well-established conventions.18\nMany kinds of objects in the ancient world include two figures represented side by side, in both seated and standing poses, but addorsed compositions are rare. Among the exceptions are terracotta vessels, bone and ivory carvings, and the above-noted ambers. In some cases, the figures are identical; in others, they are distinct.19 The significance of the addorsed pose is not clear.20\nIn Egypt, as C. Desroches Noblecourt points out, addorsed figures are a convention used to represent figures that are actually side by side.21 Stelae of the New Kingdom and later periods frequently show two deities back to back.22 The conscious pattern seen in the countless examples of paired deities, figures, or symbols is unmistakable. As Richard Wilkinson observes, “Often in fact, a pair of deities—especially goddesses—are depicted identically in dress and appearance and differ only in name, as though their very duality gave them significance enough.”23 One Etruscan example is a funerary object from Orvieto dating to the second half of the sixth century, a tufa cippus in the form of back-to-back busts of female figures, likely sphinxes, and a suitably Egyptian subject for an addorsed composition.24\nObjects with identical addorsed female subjects in Egyptian, Eastern Mediterranean, and Orientalizing Greek art may point the way for further study of the meaning of the subject type in Italy. Because 77.AO.81.1 is made of amber, the figures must be divinities, heroines, or demons. The hand gestures of the pair may emphasize the fertility and funerary aspects of the amber. If a divine subject, the pendant may represent a “duplicate divinity.” That is, as T. Hadzisteliou Price has summed up, a doubled divine image may represent one deity with two names or two aspects, natures, or cults; a deity that appears in the plural, such as the Eilithyiae; or a duplication of one goddess for the purpose of strengthening the deity\u0026rsquo;s quality.25 However, because of the subtle differences between the two figures of 77.AO.81.1, it may be that the pendant represents a dyad: that is, two discrete divine individuals.\nNotes   Citation: Warden 1994Warden, G.

Paul Getty Museum, 1977.\nCondition The piece is in excellent condition, and its surface is uniformly hard, smooth, and shiny. The amber is crazed overall and has numerous minute cracks and fissures, which are especially noticeable on the figure\u0026rsquo;s feet and in the head and body of the hare to her left. The broken tip of the left hare\u0026rsquo;s nose is the only significant loss to the pendant. In ambient light, the piece is dark red-orange and translucent; in transmitted light, the amber is transparent and bright red-orange. There is a large, cloudy inclusion in the upper body of the hare on the figure\u0026rsquo;s right side, and other inclusions are scattered throughout the piece.\nDescription The pendant is worked from a large piece of amber, rounded on both the obverse and reverse sides. The figure is identified as youthful because of the lack of beard hair and the relative body proportions. Its sex is not evident.\nThe figure wears a short, simple, schematically rendered short chiton or chitoniskos. There is no indication of the front neckline or the sleeve hems, and no belt. The top edge of the footwear is not indicated, but the smooth, close-fitting shape and pointed toe box suggest that they are boots. The figure stands in a rigid frontal pose. In each arm, the figure grasps the hind feet of a large crouching hare held head downward. The space between the figure\u0026rsquo;s neck and the hares\u0026rsquo; bodies is undefined.\nThe figure\u0026rsquo;s head is large in proportion to the body; its narrow shoulders slope slightly. The broad chest protrudes in the breast area, but there are no individualized breasts. The hips are narrow. The back is full through the upper area and concave in the lumbar region, and the rounded buttock area protrudes. The long, thin arms end in small, rounded hands. Each hand shows four fingers and the roots of the thumbs. The legs are thick, short, and sturdy and the thighs and calves full, and are contiguous for their full length. No knees are indicated. The feet are small.\nGeometry and pattern infuse the face: it is round, broad, and flat; the curve of the hairline in front is echoed by that of the eyebrow ridge, and the line of the lower eyelids mirrors that of the chin. The eyes are blank, elongated ovals that are plastically rendered and outlined with raised eyelid rims. The outer canthi are higher than the inner ones, and the left eye is narrower and slanted farther upward than the right. Both the frontal and parietal eminences of the cranium are wide. The otherwise flat forehead bulges slightly at the brow ridge, but there is no indentation for the root of the long nose, which lies at an angle close to the face. The upper lip area is short, the mouth small, and the mentolabial sulcus shallow. The mouth is wider than the nose, the lower lip wider than the upper. A groove indicating the mouth furrow runs from the top of the nose wings to the corners of the mouth. The lips, formed by two nearly parallel bars separated by a groove, have their corners punctuated by drilled indentations. The chin is also wide and projects slightly, the under-chin area full and angled downward to the neck. In front, the smooth cap of hair is raised above the plane of the brow; in back, the hair follows the shape of the skull and is wide through the crown and indented below the occipital protuberance. A point of hair at the neck extends below the juncture with the spine (in the cervical region) and must overlap the neckline of the tunic in back.\nThe hares are large compared to the human figure and are powerfully built, with compact, muscular shoulders and legs. Their forelegs are stretched out under their chins and the hind legs are tucked up close under the bodies. On each animal, an incision line separates the front of the face from the back of the head. The hares\u0026rsquo; ears are long and pointed and lie flat against their shoulders. Their longish tails hang down their backsides, with the tips of each tail touching the head of the human figure, creating a parallel line across the top of the pendant.\nThere are abrasion and scraping marks in many places on the pendant. Drill holes define the indentation between the toes and footpads of the hares\u0026rsquo; feet and punctuate the corners of the figure\u0026rsquo;s mouth, the corners of the hares\u0026rsquo; mouths, and the roots of the hares\u0026rsquo; ears.\nThe pendant is drilled for suspension with two long perforations, both of which exit at the top, in the crown of the figure\u0026rsquo;s head. The perforations\u0026rsquo; lower ends exit on the reverse: one hole is between the foot of one hare and just below the figure\u0026rsquo;s left ear, and the other is in the crook of the hare\u0026rsquo;s foot near the figure\u0026rsquo;s right elbow. The least visible and perhaps the strongest method of suspending the pendant would have required two filaments, each tied in a knot at the lower end of the reverse exit holes, the two meeting at the top hole and knotted at this juncture.\nDiscussion Although it is comparable in style, technique, and sculptural conception to the other five pendants in the Getty group— Citation: 77.AO.84Cat. no. 1 (cat. no. 1), Citation: 77.AO.85Cat. no. 2 (cat. no. 2), Citation: 77.AO.81.1Cat. no. 3 (cat. no. 3), Citation: 77.AO.81.2Cat. no. 5 (cat. no. 5), and Citation: 77.AO.81.3Cat. no. 6 (cat. no. 6)—there are no close parallels for this pendant in any media. All six pendants demonstrate stylistic and iconographic connections with Near Eastern, Peloponnesian, South Ionian, Cypriot, and native Italian sculpted objects in bronze, ivory, terracotta, and amber. Like those of the other five, the composition of 77.AO.82 is of an ancient type and shows well the broad range of visual schema, techniques, and styles current in northern inland Etruria.\nNo definite conclusion has been reached about the sex or age of the figure. As to identity, the composition, the age-old “Mistress” or “Master” of the Animals schema, announces that the figure is heroic or divine (or both). The proportions, head-to-body and legs-to-torso, the short neck, high chest, and small feet, and the relative scale of hares and figure, seem to suggest that the figure is that of a child, but there exist many images of adults with these characteristics in Greek and Etruscan art of this and earlier periods.\nThe somatic parallels with some images of children in Hittite art are striking. A critical comparison is the rock-crystal figure of a child in the Walters Art Museum, which Jeanny Vorys Canby demonstrates to be a “Hittite expression of the miraculous child concept.”1 The short hairstyle, head-to-body proportions, and general sculptural form are remarkably alike.\nNeither the hairstyle nor the dress of 77.AO.82 indicates with certainty the sex or age of the central figure. The hair is short and somewhat similar to what Emeline Richardson calls the Etruscan Ducktail, the masculine chin-length cut worn by Early Etruscan votive bronzes of elite males, swordsmen, spearmen, and kouroi.2 It is not far from the fashion of the sacrificing youth of the Campana Panel, which Sybille Haynes interprets as hair shorn in mourning.3 The amber figure\u0026rsquo;s hair can be compared to certain images of Artemis, but it has no analogue. A bronze statuette of Artemis (or an adorant or juvenile dedicant) from Lusoi has hair that is cut short in back and with short bangs, a boxy hairdo. This bronze dates to the end of the sixth century and is thought to be a variant of a cult statue of Artemis Hemera, goddess of Lusoi. It conserves much older traits.4 Overall, it is the object most similar to 77.AO.82 in hairstyle, dress, and the blocklike body. Parallels for the hair may also be drawn with some ivories of Artemis Orthia from her Spartan sanctuary. In these, the divinity is young and has cropped hair; in some cases she wears a feather headdress.5 These Spartan figures wear a long, smooth-fitting dress that contrasts with the shorter one worn by 77.AO.82 and the shorter chitons of the Lusoi bronzes. The Spartan ivories belong to what may be the oldest type of Artemis representations, that of the goddess in the form of a frontal draped standing figure.6\nThe amber figure\u0026rsquo;s dress—the plain, short dress and boots (or bare feet)—is not unusual for male figures, hunters, archers, shepherds, charioteers, riders, athletes, and flying figures, but it is uncommon for females. An important comparison is one of a pair of seventh-century female stone figures from Casale Marittimo (Volterra). Figure A wears a perizoma over a short tunic and a long braid (and her disproportionately long arms and hands are held across her chest in the “mourning gesture”).7 Later Campanian and Etruscan bronze archers (of circa 530–500) wear leggings under a very similar short costume, but many of the latter are not clearly sexed; they are often also called Scythians and Amazons.8 Early Etruscan masculine parallels for the clothing of 77.AO.82 are the tunics worn by three bucchero athletes (who also wear the perizoma) and at least one of the hunters on the Bernardini sheath,9 as well as the riders on the terracotta relief plaques from the principal building at Poggio Civitate.10 Later sixth-century examples are two of the male subjects of the antefixes from the Temple B cell-row building at Pyrgi, the winged and rayed sun-god Usil, and a bird-headed figure, who is probably Lucifer, the morning star.11 Important Greek masculine parallels for the amber\u0026rsquo;s dress (and for its iconography) are the sixth-century Arcadian and Sicyonian bronzes representing Hermes Kriophoros and other unnamed shepherds,12 certain Ionian bronzes of active figures,13 and an ivory figure of a horse-tamer from Vathy, Samos.14 All these works present the short garment as a close-fitting, smoothly rendered sheath of thick cloth.\nAmong the Greek female parallels for the short chiton are various active figures, athletes and huntresses most notably. As Eva Parisinou outlines, the short hunting dress is worn not only by Artemis, but also by the huntresses Atalante and Prokris, by the hunting female demons Gorgon and the Erinyes, and by female athletes.15 The short garment may denote the status of the figure and its activity; the same was true for girls who wore the exomis at the Olympian heraia.16 One of the earliest antecedents for 77.AO.82—if it is female—is a unique and early Greek bronze of an armed female from Thermon, variously dated between the twelfth and eighth centuries.17 She wears a short chiton, necklace, and boots, and carries a bow in her right hand. Her hair is gathered up under a pointed hat. This may be the same subject as a bronze of a running “girl” from Samos of about 600.18 Etruscan parallels for the chiton of 77.AO.82 include that of the figure controlling winged horses (Thesan/Dawn), who decorates another of the six astronomical antefix types from the south side of Temple B of Uni/Astarte at Pyrgi;19 the bird-grasping divinity represented on a series of Etruscan terracotta antefixes from Capua;20 and a bronze found at Pietrabbondante. The bird-tamer\u0026rsquo;s chiton is longer than the hare-tamer\u0026rsquo;s, but it is similarly rendered—simple in its line, it suggests easy movement. (The Capuan figures and the amber hare-tamer are also comparable in their general proportions, youthfulness, face shape, short neck, and long, thin arms.) The bronze from the Pietrabbondante sanctuary wears a shortened dress, and her short hair forms a point in back.\nThe Ionian aspects of the amber hare-tamer\u0026rsquo;s style are brought out not only by comparison to the Samian bronze of the running girl and to the Ionian-looking Peleus from the Loeb stand C,21 but particularly to the ivory horse-tamer in Vathy. The last and 77.AO.82 also share iconography (both figures have short hair and wear unbelted chitons and smooth-fitting boots) and a similar technique (low relief, smooth modeling, and an analogous use of graving tools).\nSeven other Etruscan sculptural comparisons, all strongly Ionian in style, are related to 77.AO.82, not only in artisanal terms, but also in iconography. They are a large terracotta votive statuette from Portonaccio, Veii,22 and four related bronze works: the “Herakles” from Valle Fuino (Cascia) in the Vatican; a bronze in Geneva (Musée d\u0026rsquo;Art et d\u0026rsquo;Histoire MF 1017); one in the Louvre; and another in the Getty Museum (96.AC.124).23 All these figures are distinguished by tall, pointed headdresses or hats that curve forward and animal skins, which in most cases are arranged so the heads hang in front of the pubic area, in sporranlike fashion. Massimo Pallottino suggested that the Portonaccio terracotta represented an unnamed divinity of the Etruscan pantheon, and Giovanni Colonna convincingly associated it with the cult of Aritimi in the sanctuary at Veii.24\nIn answer to the question of who is represented in 77.AO.82, two depictions of masculine figures with hares are important. The winged and snake-tailed male demon of an Etruscan repoussé relief, dated to 600–585 B.C., holds a hare and a lotus flower in his left hand and a wader in his right.25 A sixth-century haruspex on a gold ring, who holds a hare in the left hand, is a valuable testimony to the sacrifice of the hare in Etruscan haruspicy. The ring, probably from Vulci, was once identified by Rodolfo Siviero as Artemis.26\nThe composition of 77.AO.82 is also eloquent in establishing the perimeters of the identity. The image of a contest between a human figure and animals is known in Mesopotamian art since the fourth millennium and is generally interpreted as a symbol of power or control over nature, and possibly also as a symbol of protection.27 While both male and female protagonists are known in the art of the Minoan-Mycenaean world, the female is more common. Images of the female figure with animals, first named Potnia on Linear B tablets, seem to have incorporated the Mesopotamian ideology relating to this composition. In Greek Olympian religion, this Mistress of the Animals disappeared and her role and divine attributes were incorporated by other goddesses, among them Athena, Rhea, Hera, and Artemis. In Italy, there appears to have been incorporation by some unnamed divinities. By the seventh century in Greece and in Italy, the “mastery of the animals” schema was adapted to fit current needs, with variants sometimes differing significantly from the Oriental prototypes. Nevertheless, some elements remain constant, chief among them the symmetrical scheme, the frontality of the female figure, and the animals. Although in Italy, images of a “mistress” are more frequent than those of a “master,” both subjects are found in Etruscan art. The “master” is usually shown between horses and the “mistress” is shown as overcoming lions, most commonly, and birds (raptors and waterbirds, especially geese and swans).\nWhile some scholars believe that the mastery imagery came directly from the Orient to central Italy, others have proposed that the subject was transformed in the Mediterranean East before its adoption on the Italian peninsula. There was direct contact with Cretan material in some instances.\nHomer calls Artemis Potnia Theron (mistress of the wild beasts) in the Iliad (21.470). I. Krauskopf has argued that the Potnia Theron known in Etruria from the seventh century onward is more like a demon than a divinity proper (such as Artemis) and that there was no early connection between Artemis and Potnia Theron, since in Etruria the latter is never represented with Artemis\u0026rsquo;s favorite animals.28 Noting that there is no identifiable Artemis (Artumes) in Etruria before the second half of the sixth century, she suggests that if there is a blending of the two, it is perhaps under Greek influence. H. Damgaard Andersen suggests that the Potnia Theron figure of central Italy must be considered a local goddess and her cult a nature-worshipping one.29 She proposes that the goddess\u0026rsquo;s iconography changed in the Orientalizing period from the primitive Iron Age figure into one more like Near Eastern forms under the influence of luxury objects brought to Italy by Phoenician merchants and traders, “who in this way might have initiated an important development of the Italic religious beliefs or at least of the iconography of these deities.”30 Further, she argues that the importance of Potnia Theron diminished by the second half of the sixth century, since images of the goddess became scarce except in bucchero, and proposes that throughout the seventh and sixth centuries, as the Etruscan pantheon was slowly established, strongly influenced by the Greek, the old Potnia Theron seems to have been subsumed, possibly into aspects of more than one deity but including Ishtar/Astarte or Uni, Artemis/Artumes, or perhaps Vei/Ceres.\nWhat Sybille Haynes sagely comments about Etruscan Orientalizing nude females of ivory and gold is relevant for female divinities of the period more generally: “It is possible that these images corresponded to preexisting concepts of nature divinities flanked by birds and quadrupeds that figured in earlier representations on open worked bronze vessels found as far apart as Bisenzio, Bologna, and Spadarolo.”31\nThe hares, too, are critical to the identity of 77.AO.82. They bear a strong stylistic similarity to the lions of the group— Citation: 77.AO.81.2Cat. no. 5 and Citation: 77.AO.81.3Cat. no. 6—especially in the detail of the line separating the faces from the upper part of the head, and to the comparisons presented for them in the catalogue entries below. Both in style and subject, they relate to the pairs of lions held by Potnia Theron figures molded on the handles of a series of bucchero kyathoi from Chiusi and Poggio Civitate.32 (See Citation: 77.AO.81.2Cat. no. 5 and Citation: 77.AO.81.3Cat. no. 6 for further discussion.)\nHares are an uncommon subject of jewelry and amulets in the art of Greece and ancient Italy, but they are much more commonly represented in vase painting of the seventh and sixth centuries. The few early examples of the hare as a subject of an Etruscan object of adornment (amulet, pendant, or ring) stand out. One is a tiny ivory pendant-amulet from Murlo, which this author identifies as a curled-up, couchant hare. Another is a carved carnelian with a crouching hare.33\nThe hares of 77.AO.82 are not newborns but large, mature animals. Wild hares, such as the indigenous Italian Lepus corsicanus and the Lepus europaeus, may grow to 75 cm in length.34 (It should be noted that the females of the Italian hare are larger than the males of the species.) “When going it springs,” says Xenophon of the hare; “no one has ever seen or will ever see a hare walking.”35 Hares possess excellent senses of sight, smell, and hearing; they were the fastest of the wild animals of ancient Italy; and they can dodge and change direction quickly or dive into streams if needed, as they are able swimmers.36\nA successful chase would no doubt attest to the hunter\u0026rsquo;s great fleetness of foot, command of the coursers, perhaps, and success with the throwing stick. Catching a hare might also be the result of a good snare. The hares of 77.AO.82 are in a crouching pose, alert yet carried head downward and encircled in the arms of the smaller figure, emphasizing the power of the hunter.\nThe wide-open eyes of the hares may specifically allude to the ancient belief that the animal slept with its eyes open and was thus always vigilant. Since the hare is also a burrower, a creature that moves between the earth and the subterranean realm, it had, like the snake, chthonic associations.\nHares rarely accompany figures in the mastery pose. Lions are the most common subject, long-necked waterfowl (especially waders) the second most common, and horses the third. There appears to be but one extant example of a hare-grasping female divinity: the main subject of the handle of a Laconian mid-sixth-century bronze hydria found at Grächwil, Switzerland.37 The figure, called by some scholars Artemis and by others Potnia Theron, stands atop lions and bearded snakes and holds a pair of live hares firmly in her hands, one head upward and the other head downward. A raptor is perched atop her crown.\nIn some societies today, birds and hares are among the first wild prey children learn to hunt, chase, or trap.38 Of course, hare hunting was not limited to the young in the ancient world; Xenophon\u0026rsquo;s Cynegiticus, for instance, is especially concerned with chasing hares. As an animal of the wild, the hare belonged to the deities of the hunt. Xenophon recommends that a hound be loosed on a hare only after registering a vow to Apollo and Artemis the Huntress, and that hunters dedicate newborn hares to Artemis.39 Not only did Artemis watch over the newborn, as noted above; she also protected the unborn.40 Callimachus, writing in the third century and drawing on a wealth of ancient tradition, claims that Artemis\u0026rsquo;s main pursuits are “the bow and the shooting of hares and the spacious dance and sport upon the mountains.”41 Callimachus also refers to Artemis as Chitone, and his Artemis asks Zeus: “Give me to gird me a tunic with embroidered border reaching to the knee, that I may slay wild beasts.”42\nIf the hare-tamer of 77.AO.82 does represent Artemis, or a related female divinity, the emphasis is on her aspect as young virgin goddess of the hunt, a double-edged role: as a fertility deity, she ensures the hunt and the well-being, safety, and reproduction of wild fauna, but as a huntress herself, she is lethal.43 If the amber represents Potnia Theron, the hares may underline her chthonic aspect.44 The Grächwil hydria handle may exemplify this. The fauna around the divinity represent her broad influence: she controls the earth dwellers, the lions; those who live both above and below the earth, the hares and snakes; and the hunter in the sky, the raptor—whose prey can be all creatures of the underground, the earth, and the sky. The hares and snakes reiterate the connection of the divinity with the realm below.\nHunting itself connects two realms, the outside, the wild, the nonlocal, and the unfamiliar with the inside, the domestic, the local, and the familiar, as Mary Helms suggests.45 Hunters are often seen as shamans who mediate between these two worlds and have the uncommon ability to participate in unknown worlds.46\nIn Egypt, the hare was the sacred animal of Wenet, an anthropomorphic goddess who wore a standard on her head with a recumbent hare. According to Plutarch, the Egyptians esteemed the hare as a symbol of divine qualities because of its swiftness and acute senses. The relation of the hare to Osiris, which has been variously affirmed, is unexplained but may have to do with the animal\u0026rsquo;s burrowing. In Greece, the hare is linked with other female and male divinities as well. One of the earliest marble korai, a headless figure from Samos (Berlin, Staatliche Museen 1750), holds a young hare.47 Previously interpreted as an offerant to Aphrodite, it has now been associated with Hera. Another Samian statuette of a kore holding a hare, a recent find, has also been considered a votive gift to Hera.48 A marble kore consecrated in the Milesian sanctuary of Artemis Kithone/Chitone holds a bird in her hand; Katerina Karakasi interprets this kore as not only venerating Artemis as a fertility and vegetation goddess, but also as goddess of the hunt.49\nIf the amber tamer is male, the hares may indicate a hunter-tamer, and Artemis\u0026rsquo;s brother may be called up. Dionysos, too, is associated with the hare: youths carry dead hares in the company of the god, and on two vases of the Amasis Painter, women (maenads) bring live hares to Dionysos, and on a vase by Lydos, a small satyr leans down to pet a hare in a scene with Dionysos and his entourage. Is the hare held by a maenad in the presence of Dionysos on the black-figure neck-amphora in Paris (attributed to the Amasis Painter) a gift to the god or an emblem of the wild nature of the god\u0026rsquo;s followers?50 However, as T. H. Carpenter points out, there does not seem to be a “consistent pattern of use for the hare in early Dionysian scenes.”51\nThe Etruscan aspects of 77.AO.82 suggest that the subject had particular relevance in Etruria, and more particularly in central, internal Etruria. Might it represent a native Italian divinity such as that represented by the Vatican “Herakles” or the Portonaccio terracotta? Or could it be a rare illustration of one of the indigenous male hero-divinities that became absorbed into the Etruscan Hercle of the fifth century?\nOn balance, given the ancient connection between amber and divinities of light, the iconographic and stylistic connections of 77.AO.82 to the Artemis Orthia ivories, the Laconian Grächwil hydria, the Lusoi bronzes, and the Samian bronze girl, the evidence seems to support a female identity for the figure. The pendant may represent the Greek (Laconian?) Artemis accommodated to a native female hunting divinity, one traditionally represented in the Potnia Theron schema. Whichever hunting divinity is represented, the pendant would offer protection. If Artemis, she would offer special protection for women in childbirth, not just because of her skill in midwifery, but also because she offers death to women for whom the pain of childbirth would be too great.52 In the Iliad Hera reminds Artemis, “It was against women that Zeus made you a lion, and granted that you might kill whichever ones you choose.”53 This more violent side of Artemis, from as early as the seventh century, fueled apotropaic magic, and medicine.54 In late antiquity, Artemis the bow-bearer was called upon in “aggressive” magic and medicine as quite literally a “pain-killer.”55 So, too, were Apollo and Herakles. In the rituals of death and in the tomb itself, this ornament-amulet would have offered protection of the most powerful sort. Still to be resolved is the possible relationship of this image with the iconography of the Hittite child. Might this figure, too, incorporate something of the miraculous-child concept?\nThroughout antiquity, the hare\u0026rsquo;s proverbial fertility made it a rejuvenating symbol, and it was used in direct magic to ensure regeneration.56 As an ornament, this large, shining amber carving must have made a great impression with its potent imagery; as an amulet, it would have served its owner(s) well in life and death.57 Among the few examples of amber hare pendants is another pendant in the Getty ( Citation: 79.AO.75.28Cat. no. 30, cat. no. 30), a “doubled” fertility amulet combining a hare and a cowrie.58 In magical terms, the hares of 77.AO.82 may have mirrored, increased, or focused the fertility and healing aspects of the divinity they refer to, accelerating the speed with which the pendant could ward away danger (a hare\u0026rsquo;s foot gives the owner the animal\u0026rsquo;s fleetness of foot) or promote rapid healing.\nNotes   J.

Baltimore and London, 2001., p. 95. ↩ For the Grächwil hydria, see cat. no. 2, n. 23. That the figure is the handle of a hydria is significant, especially in the context of the gray marble perirrhanterion (circa 660–50), a cult object from the Corinthian sanctuary of Poseidon at Isthmia. Its basin is supported by a quartet of Potnia Theron caryatids holding lions by the tail, with large ram protomes flanking the ring support. E. Neilsen recognized this as the same deity represented in the roof tiles in the early workshop building at Poggio Civitate. N. Winter (see n. 27, above), p. 229, notes, “The association of Potnia Theron with the water basin and the edges of a roof where water drains from the eaves may be connected to the role of female caryatids as votive water bearers.” Winter differs with Citation: Damgaard Andersen 1993Damgaard Andersen, H. “The Origin of Potnia Theron in Central Italy.” Hamburger Beiträge zur Archäologie 19/20 (1992/93 [1996]): 73–113.\u0026rsquo;s theory that the Phoenicians introduced the figure of Potnia Theron into Etruscan Italy from the Near East. Winter sees a different intermediary, at least for the roofs she discusses. The other animal represented on the perirrhanterion, the ram, is important in the context of carved amber pendants, for rams\u0026rsquo; heads are the next most numerous subjects after female heads and are frequently found in conjunction with them. ↩ Because of the Laconian associations of style and iconography in 77.AO.82, a story recounted by Plutarch may be relevant: One day, at Sparta, while youths and boys were exercising inside the colonnade, a hare appeared, and the boys, still naked, ran out and chased it. For the erotic aspects of the hare and the chase, see Citation: Barringer 2001Barringer, J. M. The Hunt in Ancient Greece. Baltimore and London, 2001.; A. Schnapp, Le Chasseur et la cité: Chasse et érotique dans la Grèce anciènne (Paris, 1997); and B. Ginge, The Erotic Hare (Odense, 1981). For the association between Aphrodite and the hare, see Citation: Freyer-Schauenburg 1974Freyer-Schauenburg, B. Bildwerke der archaischen Zeit und des strengen Stils: Samos. Vol. 11. Bonn, 1974., p. 30. Plutarch\u0026rsquo;s telling of the story in regards to the hunting in Sparta may be of greater relevance for 77.AO.82. The discussion by R. De Puma, Etruscan Tomb-Groups: Ancient Pottery and Bronzes in Chicago\u0026rsquo;s Field Museum of Natural History (Mainz, 1986), pp. 32–33, of Archaic-period East Greek vessels in the form of a dead hare, sheds light on more than the perfume vases. ↩ Xenophon, Cyn. 5.14. Later in the text (5.33), he writes, “Thus the sight of the hare is so pleasing that there is no one who would not forget about whomever [or whatever] he loved once he saw the hare being tracked, found, pursued, and caught.” ↩ Artemis is angered at the death of a mother hare and her unborn in Aeschylus\u0026rsquo;s Agamemnon. ↩ Callimachus, Dian. 2 (Callimachus: Hymns and Epigrams; Lycophron; Aratus, trans. A. W. and G. R. Mair, Loeb Classical Library 129 [London, 1921]). ↩ Callimachus, Dian. 11–12. A stock subject in Attic and Proto-Corinthian vase painting is the dog-chasing-hare motif; the dog with prey in its mouth (often a hare) is the subject of a series of Archaic bronze and terracotta figurines in which the dog usually seizes the back legs of the hare (Citation: Langdon 1993Langdon, S., ed. From Pasture to Polis: Art in the Age of Homer. Exh. cat. Columbia, MO, 1993., p. 57. Might this subject relate to the constellation of Orion\u0026rsquo;s hound pursuing a hare? ↩ Of particular interest in Etruria are the molded frieze of hounds pursuing hares decorating the raking gutter (sima) of a building in the Archaic Building Complex at Poggio Civitate; the contemporary hare-hunting frieze on the Etrusco-Corinthian “Tragliatella” jug (from a seventh-century elite woman\u0026rsquo;s tomb at Cerveteri, Capitoline Museums 358); the inclusion of the hare (without hounds) in the rows of animals on vases, such as the Caeretan amphora in the Getty Museum (71.AE.289), attributed by J. G. Szilágyi to the Etrusco-Corinthian Group of the Scale Amphorae (perhaps by the Le Havre Painter), of circa 630–600; or the head decoration of a pair of recumbent hares and a pair of lions worn by the bearded head of the Etrusco-Campanian infundibulum in Copenhagen. Might the subject have also had a danger-averting function, as did the Gorgon antefixes and the panther masks decorating the roofs? Citation: Haynes 2000Haynes, S.

In Egypt, the Cape hare was a frequent subject of desert hunting scenes in tombs. By the New Kingdom, the scene of the desert hunt was already an age-old theme, one of many symbolizing regeneration. Amulets in the shape of a hare have a long history in Egypt. The earliest surviving example is dated to the Old Kingdom; they are occasional in the Middle Kingdom, and more common in the Late Dynastic and Ptolemaic periods. Faïence images of hares were deposited in tombs, probably because “the figures had some magical or amuletic significance” (Citation: Houlihan 1986Houlihan, P. F. The Birds of Ancient Egypt. Warminster, 1986., p. 70. Citation: Andrews 1994Andrews, C. Amulets of Ancient Egypt. Austin, TX, 1994., p. 64, summarizes: “The hare was credited with powers of regeneration, but its swiftness of movement and the keenness of its senses were also well known: it was even believed to sleep with its eyes open. Its fecundity, of course, was proverbial. Thus a hare amulet could have worked in life to endow its wearer with fertility or rapidity of movement, or in death with hope of rebirth.” Erwin R. Goodenough, Jewish Symbols in the Greco-Roman Period (New York, 1953–68), 8:93, sees remarkable persistence in the type and use of hare imagery from the Egyptian, Hittite, and Greek past through Judaism and early Christianity until the early modern period, suspects it was a generally popular symbol of immortality, and believes “[it] represented Dionysus and all other fertility deities through whose destruction and love men came, usually in mysteries, to look for immortality.” ↩ The hare is a solar symbol in ancient Egypt.

Caltabiano, “Il simbolismo del ‘Lepre’: Influenze ideologico-religiose dell\u0026rsquo;Egitto sull\u0026rsquo;area dello Stretto riflesse dal documento monetale,” in L\u0026rsquo;Egitto in Italia dall\u0026rsquo;Antichità al Medioevo: Atti Congresso Internazionale Italo-Egiziano, Rome and Pompeii, November 13–19, 1995, eds.

Paul Getty Museum, 1977.\nCondition The pendant is in a good state of preservation, intact with the exception of a chipped portion of the bird\u0026rsquo;s head and bill. The surface is firm overall, with some abraded areas, minute cracks, overall crazing, and shallow chips. There is little surface deterioration or crust. Shallow chips are missing from the left side of the lion\u0026rsquo;s jaw, the right front elbow, and the lower edge of the left rear leg. One sizable crack crosses obliquely across the lion\u0026rsquo;s left shoulder. There are small internal fissures throughout the piece.\nThe amber is reddish brown. At the modern break on the bird\u0026rsquo;s head, the interior red-orange color of the material is visible. It is translucent in ambient light, but when subjected to transmitted light, it is transparent and a rich red. Numerous inclusions (or, possibly, deterioration pits) are visible in the lion\u0026rsquo;s chest, belly, and rump and in the base of the bird\u0026rsquo;s neck. Before it entered the museum, the pendant is reported to have been lightly cleaned.\nDescription This pendant is carved from an oblong piece of amber and is conceived fully in the round. The two main sides are nearly identical. Only the position of the lion\u0026rsquo;s tail—which descends from the root downward, winds beneath the body and up around the right haunch, and terminates on the right hip—breaks the symmetry of the composition. The bottom surface of the pendant, including the legs and belly, is compressed more than are the two flanks. Between the body and legs on both the underside and the flanks are areas of the pendant without design (to be read as negative space). On the underside, the amber has been sharply cut-in to differentiate between the sunken undersurface and the body parts.\nThe lion looks back in a complete swivel. Its legs and feet are drawn compactly up under its body, the lower legs and feet stiffly parallel. The legs are angular, thin, and short, contrasting with the compact bulk and round curves of the lion\u0026rsquo;s head and body. The pads and toes, especially of the back legs, are talon-shaped. The smooth blanket of the lion\u0026rsquo;s mane is raised away from the face in front, standing up like a crewcut, and falls forward in a semicircular section between the ears. Around the face at the point of juncture of the jaws, the mane juts forward into a cusp of fur. A Z-shaped shallow groove comes to a V above the nose. The folded-back ears have a barely discernible pointed tuft of hair in front and lie well back on the head. The eyes are plastic and almond-shaped, with the outside corners sloping sharply upward. Outlined below by a continuous engraved line, the eyes are set off above by a line that also defines the length of the nose. An extremely fine ridge connects to the cusp. The lion\u0026rsquo;s mouth is open, exposing the teeth (better preserved on the left side than on the right), including the sharp upper canines extending down over the lower canines. The lower jaw is suspended squarely under the cheek, emphasizing the stylized, squared-off form of the head; the chin is rounded by the exaggeration of the semicircular flaps.\nOn the lion\u0026rsquo;s back, and partly in its mouth, is a long-necked waterbird in the reguardant pose, with its head reverted. The neck is turned back so that the head and bill rest flat on its body. Although the breast of the bird is in the lion\u0026rsquo;s mouth, the teeth do not indent the flesh. In proportion to the lion, the bird is large. A shallow indentation separates the bird\u0026rsquo;s body from the large spread of the wing below it. The bird is more precisely rendered on its left side, where the triangular section below the wing (overlapping the lion\u0026rsquo;s body) is more easily read.\nIn the area of the juncture of the face and mane is a smoothed depression, well blended into the design. The perforation holes are the same diameter here as on Citation: 77.AO.82Cat. no. 4 (cat. no. 4) and the two Kourotrophos pendants, Citation: 77.AO.84Cat. no. 1 (cat. no. 1) and Citation: 77.AO.85Cat. no. 2 (cat. no. 2). Located on the right side of the neck is a stopped bore 4 mm in diameter. Engraved lines are visible throughout the piece. On the body, around the lower part of the lion\u0026rsquo;s head, below the bird\u0026rsquo;s body, circling the eye, and on the left flank are small hatchings and parallel series of scratch marks. The pendant was bored with a triangular set of perforations, one piercing the thorax from side to side, and one each from the exits of this through-bore to a hole on the front of the neck. When strung, the lion would have been suspended neck upward with its legs perpendicular to the ground.\nDiscussion This pendant has no exact parallel in subject or composition. For the style of the animals and bird, the closest comparisons are the lions of Citation: 77.AO.81.3Cat. no. 6 (cat. no. 6), the hares of Citation: 77.AO.82Cat. no. 4, the waterbird of Citation: 77.AO.85Cat. no. 2, and two lions\u0026rsquo; heads in the Louvre.1 The squared-up compositional type of 77.AO.81.2 is not uncommon in Etruscan Orientalizing art. It is similar to the faunal compositions found in Etruscan goldwork, in bronze reliefs, and on bucchero. A nearly identical parallel for the amber is the pair of (possible) fibulae molded onto the shoulders of an enthroned canopic figure in Chiusi dated to the second half of the seventh century.2 A close comparison for 77.AO.81.2 is a double lion motif stamped on a number of impasto cup handles from Poggio Civitate (Murlo).3\nIn spite of its schematic rendering, the bird of 77.AO.81.2 can be classified as a swan and, more specifically, as a mute swan. The salient characteristics are its large size in relation to the lion, its extremely long neck, and the volume of its wing area, but perhaps most importantly the diagnostic basal knob on the upper mandible.4 The amber image corresponds to the modern bird as well as to Egyptian illustrations of the mute swan.5 Did the artisan of the pendant know the lion and bird from firsthand knowledge or only from other representations? While there appear to have been no lions in ancient Italy, the mute swan is still a migrant visitor to the area.\nThe lions of 77.AO.81.2 and Citation: 77.AO.81.3Cat. no. 6 and the amber heads in the Louvre are related in style to a large group of archaic Etruscan lions, mainly bronze reliefs, first gathered together by W. L. Brown.6 This large and varied group of lions is characterized by an amalgamation of early Etruscan lion types, which show strong links with the Near East, with Assyrian and Hittite types modified by East Greek stylizations and motives. The lions of the two lion-subject pendants in this group reveal their genealogies. The folded-back ear is a variant of the old Hittite heart-shaped form. The shape and slant of the eyes, the squared-off face, the curve of the lower jaw, and the form of the mane in front reveal their genetic ties with the ferocious lions of Assyria. The East Greek stylizations are brought out by comparison to lions from Ionia.\nTwo of Brown\u0026rsquo;s lion groups are more closely related than others to the lions of 77.AO.81.2 and Citation: 77.AO.81.3Cat. no. 6. The first group includes two important parallels: the repoussé-formed lions of two reliefs from a chariot excavated from a “princely” tomb at Castel San Mariano di Corciano.7 The lion\u0026rsquo;s head of Thetis from the front of the chariot and the lion helmet of Herakles on the side panel are very close matches for the heads of these Getty amber lions. They have in common similar squared-off faces, jaws with deep mandibles, comparably formed eyes, folded-back ears, and smooth manes. The Thetis lion has the same distinctive cusp of the ruff on the cheek found on the lions of 77.AO.81.2 and Citation: 77.AO.81.3Cat. no. 6. The amber lions are also related to the lions of the “Loeb” cauldron from Marsciano in Munich.8 They, too, have this distinctive cheek-ruff tuft. The Castel San Mariano chariot reliefs and the Loeb cauldron and stands reveal the impact of Ionian Greek art, especially that of Samos, as do the lions of 77.AO.81.2 and Citation: 77.AO.81.3Cat. no. 6. The second of Brown\u0026rsquo;s groups of lion relatives are all lions\u0026rsquo; heads, each significantly larger in scale than the pendants. The comparanda include the Etruscan bronze chariot pole decorations and decorative bosses (tomb decorations of some kind) from Vulci and Tarquinia. The closest examples are the lion\u0026rsquo;s head with inlaid eyes from the Vulcian Tomba del Guerriero, Osteria necropolis, in Rome,9 and the Tarquinian lacunaria in the Castellani collection.10 All the above-listed lions presented here as comparanda are likely to have been manufactured near their findspots in northern internal Etruria11 and date to the last third quarter of the sixth century.12\nA lion with prey or parts of a human body grasped in its mouth is an early and important theme in early Greek and Etruscan art, as Brown was the first to outline.13 Two other amber objects in the form of lions with prey are fibula-bow decorations, one representing a lion attacking a bull, another a lion and a deer or fawn. However, the style and compositions of these are different from 77.AO.81.2 and they are later in date, perhaps from the end of the sixth century.14\nA lion savaging a long-necked bird is a rare subject in ancient art. Among the few examples are a Greek Orientalizing earring or temple pendant from Rhodes in the Louvre;15 the aforementioned molded fibulae on the Chiusine “canopic” figure; and a painted detail on a hydria by the Micali Painter in Geneva.16 One of the many variants on the theme is a lion with prey slung over its back; this artistic convention is East Greek in origin.17 77.AO.81.2 appears to be the unique representation in amber.\nAlthough the composition of 77.AO.81.2 may have been instigated in part by the shape of the amber, the squared-up form, with the creatures\u0026rsquo; bodies pointing in one direction and the heads in another, may have had special importance. The reverted head, an age-old format in Near Eastern art, perhaps carried something of its earlier signification. For instance, in Kassite-period art, a bird with a turned-back head is found frequently as a divine symbol and attribute.18\nThe old format of the amber, as well as its character as a shimmering and golden jewel, may have called up the art and ornaments of Egypt and the Near East, and the power and status of the exotic ornaments of the Orient. It may also have called up Odysseus\u0026rsquo;s famous brooch. If it functioned as an amulet, 77.AO.81.2 might have been able to conjure up the power of the deities of the wild, or the heroes and gods who conquered birds and animals. The lion may even represent symbolically a particular hero or divinity. The symbolism of the swan in the ancient world and in Italy, and specifically its importance to the people who would have seen this amber, deserves further study.\nThe owner of such an object may have taken on by assimilation the power, bravery, and ferocity of the storied animal and the material as well. On the principle of “like banishing like,” an amber lion amulet might avert terrible danger and protect its owner in life or death. Through amuletic assimilation, a lion-subject amulet might incorporate danger-averting and protective functions for its owner.\nThe lion of 77.AO.81.2 might have carried deeply embedded cultural meanings such as were known in the Near East. Among the earliest surviving of all ancient Near Eastern amulet types is the lion, and in literature the lion was long the metaphor for warlike kings and fierce deities. In the Neo-Assyrian period, the lion was a “generally magically protective type, known as urgulû.”19 In Egypt, the lion was a symbol of the sun-god Ra, and by extension a symbol of the god Amun. As a desert dweller, the lion was believed to have regenerative capabilities and as such was a vital amulet for the dead. The lion\u0026rsquo;s conquest of the swan adds to the meaning of the image. If a sixth-century Etruscan lion pendant did to some degree incorporate Mesopotamian or Egyptian symbolism, what better material than amber, with its solar associations? In the tomb, the powerful lion, carved from a material long associated with mourning and rebirth, would have made the amulet an especially effective amulet for the deceased.\nNotes   Citation: Metzger 1991Metzger, C. “Noeud d\u0026rsquo;Héraclès et torsades: Trois bijoux hellénistiques.” Revue du Louvre 41 (1991): 18–23.. ↩ For the Chiusine urn, see Citation: Gempeler 1974Gempeler, R.

Paul Getty Museum, 1977.\nCondition The pendant is in a good state of preservation. The surface is firm and stable, although it is laced with many cracks and has overall crazing and pitting. In ambient light, the piece is translucent and dark brownish black; in transmitted light, it is translucent and orange. There are some small fissures but no visible inclusions. Before entering the Getty Museum, the pendant is reported to have been mechanically cleaned.\nDescription Although the two sides of the pendant are nearly identical, the side with fewer natural flaws is here designated the obverse. The pendant is composed of two compactly designed reguardant lions in repose that are book-matched along their ventral surfaces. At the top, functioning as a suspension device between the two felines, is a protrusion of amber. At the bottom is a section of amber that, together with the encircling tails, forms a calyxlike base.\nOn the reverse are two crevices, a deep, polished groove extending from the chest to the flank and a smaller indentation near the knee, both resulting from the removal of a fissure or inclusions before the pendant was figured. Other traces of manufacture—the engraved lines, scraped areas, and multidirectional abrasion marks—can be seen around the muzzles, haunches, and legs, and near the base of the tails. A drill was used for the interstices between the pads and toes of the lions\u0026rsquo; feet and at the corners of their mouths. The pendant has a triangular set of suspension perforations, each 2 mm in diameter. One extends laterally between the forepaws and intersects with two others, each of which goes from the top of the pendant (in the middle of the flange) to the exits of the lateral bore. When strung, the pendant would have hung with the lions\u0026rsquo; heads at the top.\nDiscussion There is no exact parallel for this pendant. 77.AO.81.3 belongs to the same Getty group as Citation: 77.AO.84Cat. no. 1 (cat. no. 1), Citation: 77.AO.85Cat. no. 2 (cat. no. 2), Citation: 77.AO.81.1Cat. no. 3 (cat. no. 3), Citation: 77.AO.82Cat. no. 4 (cat. no. 4), and Citation: 77.AO.81.2Cat. no. 5 (cat. no. 5). The lions of 77.AO.81.3 are nearly identical with the lion of Citation: 77.AO.81.2Cat. no. 5 and to a pair of amber lions\u0026rsquo; heads in the Louvre.1 They are also generally related in style to the hares of Citation: 77.AO.82Cat. no. 4. As is discussed in the entry for Addorsed Females ( Citation: 77.AO.81.1Cat. no. 3), there are also few other contemporary amber objects of doubled subjects with which to compare the two pendants. The only other amber of doubled lions is the (possibly) early-fifth-century fibula decoration from Belmonte Piceno, which represents the foreparts of two lions.2 In 77.AO.81.3, the lions are ventrally positioned, or heraldically posed (rather than addorsed).\nThe pendant is drilled for suspension so that the lions\u0026rsquo; flanks would be presented. This is also the case with the other double-subject amber pendants, the twinned animal and human figures from Tomb VI at Satricum in the Villa Giulia,3 the double lion with single face pendant from Pianello di Castelbellino in Ancona,4 and the two-figure pendant in Philadelphia, perhaps from Ascoli Piceno.5 In every case, as Warden pointed out, the pose “emphasizes the frontality of the figures and the possibly apotropaic nature of pendants of this sort.”6\nThe two lions of 77.AO.81.3 appear to be identical, but they are not. The differences are minimal and may offer an opportunity to “see” something of the hand of the carver. The ease with which right profiles are worked (in contrast to the left ones) suggest that the carver was right-handed. The most notable difference between the two lions is the tips of their tails: one is curled back and terminates in a volute (obverse left) and the other is spear-shaped. On both obverse and reverse, the right-hand profiles of the lions are more carefully defined, the mandibles rounder, and the heads slanted slightly upward; the left-hand profiles are squarer, the mandibles more angular, and the heads carved parallel to the ventral line. Overall, the form of the pendant, especially with the calyxlike form of the tails at the bottom, is reminiscent of a pommel, and although no close analogue exists, it may indicate the experience of the carver or point to a specific model in another hard material: ivory, bone, wood, antler, or horn.\nThe pairing and style of the lions of 77.AO.81.3 is comparable to the pairs of lions held by a Potnia Theron on two types of bucchero kyathos handles found at Poggio Civitate and other northern internal Etruscan sites,7 and on a bucchero infundibulum.8 The schema is unusual because the divinity holds the confronted animals in front of her body. The similarity between the bucchero decorations and 77.AO.81.3 may be taken as additional evidence for locating the manufacture of the ambers to northern internal Etruria.\nAlthough the subject of two confronted lions is age-old, they are not usually presented in a crouching position or with the bodies joined heraldically. This may be a function of fitting the lions into the amber blank\u0026rsquo;s original form, a challenge perhaps similar to that of squeezing them into a frontal composition for the handle of a bucchero kyathos. The antithetical compositional type has ancient roots in the Near East, one especially popular for upright lions. The confronted-lion compositions employed in the Aegean Bronze Age and in Orientalizing Greece are related to Hittite types.9 The composition bears remarkable similarity to the confronted lions of the Hittite Dagger God relief carving in chamber B at Yazilikaya.10\nThe composition of the doubled lions may have had a special set of functions, focusing or going beyond the meaning of the single-lion subject. The doubling may signify two lions or it may represent repetition, a basic tool of magic. Repetition is an age-old formula for increasing the potency of any amulet, spell, or curse. Another way to read the imagery of the pendant is as an extract of the Potnia Theron schema, such as the pairs adorning the handles of the bucchero kyathoi. On these bucchero cups, the lions announce the presence of the divinity.11 The divine and solar aspects of the amber may have automatically called up the presence of a divinity at the same time that the material underlined the meaning of the lions.\nA lion image is one of the oldest of all signs. Considering the importance of the lion as a subject of Egyptian amulets, the most widely dispersed in the circum-Mediterranean world, 77.AO.81.3 likely embeds something of earlier amuletic symbolism, the Egyptian and Near Eastern particularly. In Egypt, the lion was a solar animal and a protective sentinel, a powerful symbol of defense.12 As a desert dweller, the lion was believed to have regenerative powers. From early times there, a double-lion deity, Aker, the lions of yesterday and tomorrow, guarded the sun\u0026rsquo;s passage, both ends of the day, and protected the horizon.13\nNotes   Citation: Metzger 1991Metzger, C. “Noeud d\u0026rsquo;Héraclès et torsades: Trois bijoux hellénistiques.” Revue du Louvre 41 (1991): 18–23.. ↩ See cat. no. 5, n. 14. ↩ For the Satricum Tomb VI material, see Citation: Waarsenburg 1995Waarsenburg, D.

Paul Getty Museum, 1976.\nCondition There is a large chip in the break at the bow, a break at the bow set of suspension holes, and a number of small chips on the top side. A section of the keel is broken off, and there is an old fracture loss on the starboard side just above the keel. There are large fissures on the top, port, and starboard sides near the stern. The crazing is uniform overall.\nThe object is dark reddish brown in ambient light and translucent and dark reddish orange in transmitted light. There are a number of inclusions (or, possibly, deterioration pitting) throughout the piece, mostly on the port side.\nWhile in the donor\u0026rsquo;s collection, the piece was lightly cleaned and the two broken sections of the bow reattached.\nDescription The pendant is worked fully in the round. The ship has a deeply rounded hull and a heavy keel. At one end, identified here as the stern, is a curved, knoblike protrusion that must be the aphlaston, or sternpost, which is shaped like a schematic bird-head device. In front of the aphlaston is a raised structure, probably the stern castle, articulated on its sides by five parallel vertical indentations, with a division down the center on the top, and uneven protrusions (the sheet and cordage?). At the bow, in front of the figures, is an undifferentiated section of amber and, above it, a rectangular form that protrudes over the bow. This forward structure, a bow screen, or possibly a flexible upper deck, is described by two narrow horizontal fillets within which are short vertical incisions; on its top, it is marked off with transverse parallel lines. Seven figures are aboard ship. On each side are three figures, represented by their frontal heads and necks. On each side is carved the profile of a long-haired, bearded man (his head, neck, and a small section of the torso are represented); in front of him is a tied sack or other cargo. This figure sits in front of the stern castle and looks forward.\nThe six outward-facing figures are nearly identical. They have a similarly shaped oval face, centrally parted caplike hair, and cursorily modeled features. Their eyes are almond-shaped, blank, and bulging; their noses are triangular; and their mouths are formed as parallel bars. The bearded figure sits taller in the ship and is slightly larger in scale than the frontal figures. His almond-shaped eyes are set high in his face. He has a sharp, triangle-shaped nose, a prominent pointed beard, and long hair falling over his ears to the back hairline.\nThe pendant preserves evidence of its original form and its preparation before the figuration. Portside is a smoothed depression, and on the bottom is a smoothed lacuna in the keel. Three sets of through-bores perforate the pendant, at the bow, stern, and amidships between two of the passengers\u0026rsquo; necks. Each set forms a triangle: one hole perforates the body of the pendant from obverse to reverse, and the other two holes intersect this transverse bore at the exits. The latter two holes are drilled at an acute angle and meet at the topside of the piece, forming an apex. A filament or cord would have run from the apex of the triangle through the transverse bore and back up to the apex.\nDiscussion There is no close parallel for 76.AO.76; only one other related amber carving is known, a ship with sailors from Padula (Lucania), which likely served as the bow of a fibula (see below). 76.AO.76 is generally related in style to the ambers discussed in nos. 1–6 and was included in the same donation.\nThe shape of the pendant links it to a much older type of ornament, the crescent-shaped necklace, found in metal and amber, a fashion that flourished in the north and in Western Europe during the Beaker period and the early Bronze Age.1 The form, materials, and symbolism of such pectorals were exclusive to high-status individuals. It is also related to the engraved decoration of ships on two Daunian stone stelae of females.2\n76.AO.76 may be “located” in Etruria (with debts to Greek art) and dated by the compact format of the carving and the style. The frontal figures (whether passengers, sailors, or marines) are related to the Getty Kourotrophos group— Citation: 77.AO.84Cat. no. 1 (cat. no. 1) and Citation: 77.AO.85Cat. no. 2 (cat. no. 2)—and share many sculptural comparisons. The ship\u0026rsquo;s frontal figures are akin to the Etruscan bronze votives in Emeline Richardson\u0026rsquo;s Swordsman Series A, which she dates to the early sixth century.3 A work such as the male sphinx acroterium from Poggio Civitate (Murlo) of about 575 B.C. also helps to place it.4 76.AO.76 gives evidence of its connection to Etruscan art when compared to seventh-century ivories and caryatid figures from bucchero chalices.5 The seated figure\u0026rsquo;s profile is similar to the Spartan ivory plaque of Aristaios in London, and in its silhouette and harsh modeling is generally comparable to a variety of Etruscan works dating to between the late eleventh and mid-sixth centuries: some of the early male “canopic” heads from the Chiusi area, the limestone cinerary urn in the form of a seated man from Chiusi, and profile warrior heads in bucchero.6 The ivory pyxis from Pania, Chuisi, of circa 620–580 B.C., likely carved in southern Etruria,7 offers up important analogues for both frontal and profile heads and for the schematic illustration of the ship. However, there are differences: the unbearded figure of the Pania ivory is alone in the ship and handles double rudders (and his cargo consists of two amphorae). The ivory, bronze, impasto, and bucchero objects not only suggest an approximate date for 76.AO.76, but also suggest where in Etruria it may have been made and buried.\nThe ship of 76.AO.76 has many earlier and contemporaneous comparisons in the archaeological remains and in the art of the ancient Mediterranean, especially among small three-dimensional representations in terracotta, bronze, and other materials, on carved stone reliefs, in Etruscan wall painting, and most particularly in Greek vase painting. The subject also figures on coins and gems. The Etruscan shipwrecks at Giglio, Antibes, Marseilles, and Pisa offer extraordinary information about the actual vessels. Taken together, the corpus of ancient material allows a very particular knowledge of ships and ancient seafaring, even though in the images “some elements of the ship\u0026rsquo;s architecture [may be] telescoped, others expanded or otherwise exaggerated, while others [may be] disproportionately small or ignored entirely.”8\nThe Getty ship is a different kind of vessel from that represented on the Pania pyxis. The Getty amber clearly represents a rounded hull but has no oars, oarlocks, or holes. It must be one in a class of merchantmen, or cargo-carrying ships, which the Greeks called a holkadikon ploion, or holkas (towed ship), that is, a vessel dependent on masts and sails to propel it. Unequipped with oars, the holkas would have been towed in and out of harbor.9 Although the carver of 76.AO.76 has provided much detail about the ship (aphlaston, keel, stern castle, etc.), much is not indicated: there is no rudder, mast, sail, or cordage. Certainly, there were limits set by the form of the amber blank. As noted in the description, the lumpy material aft may be the stowed mast and sailing gear; alternatively, if the carriers extending from each of the three suspension points were joined up, they would form the schema of a mast and lines. The three sets of suspension holes would have enabled the pendant to hang from three separate points or to be attached to clothing or another, larger ornament, in three places. Then again, a carrier attached at each point might have been pulled up to a central point above the pendant, the lines of the carriers then forming a bisected triangle—a pattern like that of a mast and lines. Suspended this way, the rails would be parallel to the horizon, very like the position of a ship at sea.\nAnother important ship comparison is an ivory pectoral decoration from the sanctuary of Artemis Orthia at Sparta,10 where the scene is perhaps disembarkation. The subject has been interpreted as the carrying off of Helen to Troy.11 Both ornaments are lunular in shape, with just a few figures.\nThere is only one other published amber in the form of a ship, from a burial at Padula, Lucania. First published by Amadeo Maiuri in a short, illustrated note in 1914, it was found along with numerous other objects during road work in the early twentieth century. Maiuri identified the disturbed find as the remains of a woman\u0026rsquo;s grave.12 While the Padula amber ship is generally similar to the Getty ship in subject, size, and shape, suspension technique,13 degree of relief carving, and absence of a mast, they differ in artistic style, type of ship, characterization of the figures, and implied narrative.\nThe Padula ship is an oared galley with a dolphin-figured forefront, or ram. Stowed nautical equipment—mast, sail, and cordage—is visible at the top on the starboard side and above and behind the figures on the port side. Aboard are four figures facing aft and a single figure facing forward. Only the upper parts of each figure are represented; all are in profile. The figure astern has a rudder (perhaps one of a pair). The two sides of the Padula amber are dissimilar. To port, only two of the sailors are fully indicated. To starboard at the prow is a large shield, the blazon of which is an eagle in flight to the left.\nThe Padula amber is generally similar to the Getty ship and calls to mind the same stylistic comparisons. The Padula pendant compares well with many early-to-mid-sixth-century objects, including Greek vases. This proposed early date is commensurate with that of the other amber objects illustrated by Maiuri, especially bulla-shaped amber pendants, which were popular throughout much of the Italian peninsula from the early seventh century. This ship amber, too, may have been carved in Etruria, perhaps in a southern Etruscan center such as Cerveteri.\nThe two ship pendants present many questions: why a pendant with a ship subject, for whom were they made, why were they buried in a grave (as is assumed for 76.AO.76), and once there, how did they work? The ship (with and without sailors) has a long history of funerary use, from early Egypt as well as Old Europe. The amber ships may have a comparable function in tombs as that of ship models, wall paintings with ships, and vases decorated with ships (some with figures and some without).14 The Tarquinian tombs with ships, the Tomb of Hunting and Fishing and the Tomb of the Ships, underline the high-status of such imagery. The carving of ships with sailors on two Daunian stelae of women opens up many questions, some first posed by M. L. Nava.15 Do these represent objects, such as pendants? Are they part of the dress? And what role does such prominent imagery play for the deceased individuals?\nAlthough it is probable that the Getty pendant, like the Padula amber, was unearthed from a grave, both pendants may have had similar previous quotidian functions. If this is so, we might ask what the occasions were or for what reasons the pendants were worn. The Getty pendant and the Padula ship offer no evidence of wear.\nIt is possible that the original forms of the amber lumps informed the imagery—that is, the form of the raw amber determined which kind of ship would be represented, and the narrative followed. If the ship imagery symbolizes the same thing, it was surely augmented by amber\u0026rsquo;s magical aspects. It is conceivable that there was always a connection of amber with sailing, and with particular ships and voyages, real or legendary, which inspired the formation and embellishment of the raw material into these pendants.\nAmber\u0026rsquo;s natural buoyancy in saltwater may be one of the simplest explanations for the choice of a marine subject. The ship may represent, in a general sense, journey by sea, sea trade, or colonization. In the Archaic period, a successful sea journey held the promise of incredible wealth, but it was also a dangerous and risky undertaking. A ship-shaped amber pendant may have had a direct talismanic function. Was it a charm that brought good luck and good sailing?16 A ship as an amuletic subject could also represent the “vehicle” on which danger could be sent away. A curse against a night-wandering demon commands, “Go away upon swift ships!”17\nOn the other hand, did this portafortuna once promise success in trading ventures or in the establishment of a colony? It must have been the elite who sent abroad trading ships, themselves symbols of status and prestige. A ship could also stand for some of the values of aristocratic society, such as the entrepreneurial spirit or the Odysseus-like cleverness and ingenuity that was required on dangerous journeys to unknown places. Successful marine enterprises, whether for business or the establishment of colonies, contributed to the self-definition of the aristocrat. Figures such as Odysseus became Leitbilder for Greek and Etruscan aristocrats traveling far from home.18 Owning, wearing, giving, or being given an object like the Getty ship pendant might offer or affirm an identity with Odysseus, might articulate a colonial Greek, Etruscan, or Italiote\u0026rsquo;s ethnic identity, or might even affirm a genealogical connection to Odysseus. At the least, because the pendants are made of amber, they can be seen as objects of high-status material embellished or reinforced with an inherently high-status subject.\nThe ship ambers are also open to more concrete epical and mythological readings. Some of the relevant Greek stories are Theseus\u0026rsquo;s voyage to Crete; Jason and the Argonauts\u0026rsquo; search for the Golden Fleece; and Odysseus\u0026rsquo;s adventure with the sirens. There is a close connection between the Argonauts and amber. In one of the amber-origin stories, the Argo sailed up the Eridanos River and the Argonauts came upon the body of water in which Phaethon had fallen. A Homeric subject might have had a particular relevance for an amber amulet. Homer\u0026rsquo;s words were magical. “Quotations from his work could heal people when whispered in their ears or hung around their necks written on amulets, which should be preferably of gold.”19 Odysseus, in particular, was a magical figure, for he had survived transport within a mystically powerful precivilized natural world; he went to locales where the heavens seem to touch the land and sea, places between the celestial and earthly realms.20\nOdysseus\u0026rsquo;s challenge to the sirens had particular resonance in southern Italy: sirens ranged along the Tyrrhenian coast, and their home was an island offshore (perhaps real, perhaps mythical; or perhaps they were turned into rocks after their suicide).21 The bearded figure could depict Odysseus or perhaps the captain. The omission of Odysseus may have functioned as an intentional ellipsis; the wearer could symbolically replace the hero.\nAnother story known from the Odyssey,22 one not, to my knowledge, previously associated with surviving images in Greek and Etruscan art, that deserves our consideration is an episode of Menelaus\u0026rsquo;s Return. The bearded helmsmen of each pendant might, from this perspective, have been associated with Phrontis, the helmsman of Menelaus “whom no man has yet surpassed in piloting a ship when storm winds blast.” This is how in the Odyssey the horseman Nestor pays tribute to Phrontis, who was struck by Apollo “with his gentle shafts” as the ship bearing Menelaus and Nestor neared Sunium, the sacred headland, “while his hand held fast the steering rudder.” “So Menelaus, although he was keen to journey on, stopped then at Sunium to bury and to honor his companion.” Menelaus\u0026rsquo;s Return was one of the subjects painted by Polygnotos in a section of his murals in the Knidian Lesche at Delphi. Pausanias23 singled out the figure of Phrontis, in his long ekphrasis of the Lesche program, as “the only one with a beard,” and, interpreting Homer\u0026rsquo;s words, he added, “Menelaus was left behind to build Phrontis a tomb and to pay him the due rites of burial.” Certainly, a depiction that would recall Homer, Menelaus\u0026rsquo;s Return, and Nestor would have carried strong associations with burial, honor, and magic and might even have been a compelling reason for the choice of subject and for the subsequent burial in the tomb of an elite personage—even if that personage were a woman.\nIn this regard, it is useful to recall the gold votive inscription from the coastal sanctuary at Pyrgi: “Uni/Astarte, Ino/Leukothea, and Eileithyia were all mother goddesses who were supposed to help mortal women in childbirth and watch over the growth of young children, as well as save sailors.”24\nBoth the Getty and Padula ships may allude to the barque of the sun.25 If there is a solar connection, the object may be linked to Bronze Age illustrations of the solar journey, the metaphor for rebirth,26 and to a unique Etruscan depiction of the sun barque (with three passengers) sailing eastward, above the solar god driving his horses, on a mirror from Orbetello.27 One part of the route to the resting place of the dead was over the sea, to a place “which evoked an occidental archipelago of the blessed, an Afterworld beyond the ocean, in the sector belonging to the netherworld\u0026rsquo;s gods,” as Jean-René Jannot writes, and it is “a sea monster or a ship of the high seas” that brings the dead to the other shore.28 Such a vision of the afterworld may owe much to the Bronze Age in northern Europe, the source of the amber.\nNotes   L.

The last\u0026rsquo;s two ships are variously interpreted: some scholars identify the one as Greek and the other as Etruscan, Phoenician, or Italic. Whether consciously made to represent Greek versus non-Greek, or whether there are just two types of ship actually engaged in battle, the function of the krater as a grave good may be similar to that of the amber ship-shaped carvings.

Paul Getty Museum, 1976.\nCondition Upon acquisition by the museum, the piece (which had been broken at the waist and reglued) was cleaned mechanically and treated with an amber-oil distillate. The treatment resulted in improved translucency and slight darkening. There are pinpoint losses over all the surface and small breaks along the proper right side: on the veil, the right breast, and the right arm from elbow to hand; and along the left side: on a section of the veil and the upper torso below the breast and below the left elbow. There are also breaks on the stephane, or crown, and at the proper right of the flange. The bottom of the figure from the lower hem area to the feet is missing. There is a hairline crack around the neck and shoulders. Two small spalls on the reverse reveal unweathered amber. In ambient light, this pendant has a uniform dark orange-red translucency and with transmitted light, a bright orange-red color. There are no visible inclusions.\nDescription The amber has not been chemically analyzed, but its appearance is consistent with Baltic amber. The object is flat on the reverse and concave on the obverse, suggesting the form of the piece of amber from which it was worked, but there are no depressions or grooves. The lack of visible inclusions and flow lines suggests that it was carved from amber formed inside the trunk. The flange at the top of the head is drilled from both lateral sides toward the center for the insertion of a carrier. Under strong light, the two borings are distinguishable. Some areas preserve the multidirectional scratches caused by the use of a fine abrasive: between the arm and the bodice, on the long folds of the garment, and at the juncture of face and hair.\nThe figure wears a chiton with belt, veil, crown, and bodice jewelry. She holds the chiton skirt in both hands and poses with her left leg slightly in front of her right. Her face is a full oval, the brow smooth. The smallish, narrow eye sockets are shallow and empty and likely held inlays. The nose is indented slightly at the root and is set at a low angle relative to the forehead and chin. The cheeks are flattish and full. The mouth, formed in a half smile, has a short upper lip (with the tubercle indicated) that protrudes over a full lower lip indented slightly at the center. The nodes at the corners of the mouth and the mouth angle furrow are indicated by short, nearly vertical indentations. The mentolabial sulcus is shallow; the chin is small and round.\nThe hair framing the forehead is parted in the middle, and the two sections are dressed to each side in a series of four rounded waves, each undulation plastically swelled. Each side section is pulled over the top of the ear and then behind it. The figure\u0026rsquo;s hair is worn loose down the back in a fall that is curved at the bottom; it is as long as the top of the thoracic vertebrae. Over her hair is a long veil of fine fabric. Atop the veil is a crown, worn at the position of the bregma. The pendant flange at the top of the head is carved with a bead and reel.\nThe torso section of the chiton falls into two vertical folds that overfall the waist in full sections as far as the position of her wrists. The skirt is drawn closely against the body. In her left hand, with her thumb over the cloth, she grasps the central portion of the chiton, which is delineated by three narrow pleats. In her right hand, the thumb also atop the cloth, she holds a section of the skirt, which is pulled horizontally. It forms a vertical section of several folds. The draping of the skirt forms six evenly spaced folds, patterned into almost parallel, horizontal sections. At the waist, three raised horizontal bands signify the belt. At the neckline is a curved raised area and, at about the clavicles, a pectoral ornament. It may be attached to the neck edge of the chiton or to the inside edges of the veil lappets. The joining up of the sides of the chiton to form “sleeves” is indicated on the tops of the sleeves by two adjoining parallel raised lines. The narrow hems at the elbow are clearly indicated. The veil falls forward to her shoulders, covers her ears, and forms deep lappets that reach to the level of her armpits. The veil leaves the tips of the shoulders free and drapes down her back in a straight fall to about the position of her ankles. In the back, the veil is patterned into a series of vertical pleats to a level just above the hem of the chiton. The center of the veil is flat, unpleated, and plain; the sides of the garment are turned back, folding onto the center portion. This results in the terminal edges patterning into swallowtails. Drop-shaped fabric weights (two) are discernible at the uppermost edges of the veil\u0026rsquo;s zigzag folds.\nDiscussion 76.AO.77 is comparable in style and dress to a number of much larger objects (marbles, bronze statuettes, and terracottas) as well as to a number of other tiny figures in the form of either a kore1 or a kouros made from other precious materials, including ivory and gold or silver sheet. The metal figures, in addition to serving as pendants, also adorned earrings, headwear, and dress. The ambers are all perforated, and seem all to have been designed to hang from carriers or pins. In addition to 76.AO.77, ten other miniature amber korai are extant. Nine are complete or nearly so, and two are fragmentary. The eleven ambers of female figures in the form of korai are (1) Malibu, J.

A related amber is the two-figure pendant in New York, a draped woman in chiton and mantle holding a child (the child\u0026rsquo;s head is now missing), a kourotrophos.11\nOnly four of the above have secure documentation, the three from the large Novi Pazar “princely” burial and the single figure from a disturbed burial at Monteleone di Spoleto. Robert Heidenreich recounts that the Dresden ambers came from a grave near Rome. In the Getty Museum collection, 76.AO.77; three of the rams\u0026rsquo;-head pendants, Citation: 76.AO.82Cat. no. 39 (cat. no. 39), Citation: 76.AO.83Cat. no. 40 (cat. no. 40), and Citation: 77.AO.81.7Cat. no. 41 (cat. no. 41); and a pendant with the foreparts of a boar, Citation: 76.AO.84Cat. no. 37 (cat. no. 37), are related in style, technique, and state of conservation and are alike enough to consider the hypothesis that they may have been found in the same burial. The combination of subjects is plausible given that the Novi Pazar burial included three korai and eighty rams\u0026rsquo; heads.\nThe pendants that retain their feet (all but 76.AO.77 and one of the kore from Novi Pazar, Belgrade Museum 688/1) appear to be wearing smooth, pointed boots. The Berlin and the larger Dresden korai stand on plate bases, but the lower part of the amber from Monteleone di Spoleto is difficult to discern. Apart from the three kore from Novi Pazar, which were perforated for suspension in the feet area, all of the complete pendants were suspended from the head.12 The suspension flange on 76.AO.77 closely matches that of an amber kouros pendant in London (British Museum 41). The only other kore pendant with a flange is the smaller Dresden draped female.\nThese objects, those in amber and ivory, as well as those in precious metal, display a similar compact sculptural form, indicating that they were designed to be worn. The korai are typified by short, thick necks, long hair or veils, wide shoulders, long garments, legs and small feet close together, and arms and hands attached to the body. Some have plate bases. The nude kouroi stand with one leg slightly forward, a pose that helps the carver close the gap between them. These sculptural solutions provide extra support for potential weak spots such as the neck, arms, or feet.\n76.AO.77 has features in common with each of the other pendants, but it is most like the similarly sized Berlin pendant. There is no extant photograph of the reverse of the Berlin figure, but the two korai are similar in contour, volume, stance, and hand position, as well as general body proportions: large heads on diminutive necks (their heads make up roughly a fifth of their total height), wide shoulders and full upper arms, and a short stature. Both wear chitons with deep kolpoi and have similar long, capelike veils with lappets of cloth on the front and shoulders. Although the two pendants are close in style, and probably descend from a common artistic tradition, there are notable differences. Whereas 76.AO.77 has a bead-and-reel flange carved as part of the piece, the Berlin amber has a carrier hole bored through the head from temple to temple. The Berlin amber is more cursorily modeled than 76.AO.77. The expression of the Getty figure suggests the beginning of a smile; the face of the Berlin amber communicates greater gravity. (Is it a question of age?) The larger of the Dresden amber pendants is also veiled, but the veil does not form frontal lappets. 76.AO.77 and the Berlin, Dresden, and two of the Novi Pazar figures (688/1 and 689/1) are holding folds of drapery in both hands. Novi Pazar 689/1 displays the most marked instance of cloth grasping (as if the figure is starting a curtsy). The woman of the New York kourotrophos pendant balances the child with her right hand and holds the cloth of her garment in her left (a gesture mimicked by the child\u0026rsquo;s left hand). 76.AO.77 and the other extant amber korai and kouroi (including the Novi Pazar ambers) were probably carved in Italy. The similarities of style and form among the amber korai suggest that there is a common invention behind them. The particularities of the dress and adornment of 76.AO.77 help to locate its origins.\nThe kore’s chiton—belted, with long kolpoi, an emphasized verticality in the portrayal of the bodice folds, and a central bunching of folds—finds its best parallels among Ionian marbles, including 1) the figure on a votive relief from near Cyzicus (Berlin, Staatliche Museen 1851); 2, 3) two fragmentary marble korai figures from Miletos (Berlin, Staatliche Museen 1577 and 1744); 4) a marble from Didyma (Berlin, Staatliche Museen 1793); and 5) a Milesian-influenced marble from Theangela, Caria (London, British Museum B319).13 The kore displays the South Ionian marble sculptors\u0026rsquo; feeling for the thickness of its fabric and a correspondingly rich plasticity in the modeling.\nThe kore’s long veil is distinctly South Ionian, and perhaps characteristic of Miletos. The cloth surrounds the face and neck, covering the ears before falling down the back.14 Two small lappets are formed at the shoulders, so that the presence of the garment is obvious from a frontal view.15 In contrast with the tighter Samian arrangement, “around the temples the veil swells to suggest the hair underneath.”16 Characteristically South Ionian (and perhaps even distinctly Milesian rather than Samian) are the zigzag folds of the veil.17 The cloth weights attached to the ends of the veil show how well the carver understood the light garment. 76.AO.77, which can be viewed in the round, may be one of the best available illustrations of the Ionian long veil, since all of the other extant examples from the area are partial figures or are represented frontally on reliefs.\nThe physical type might also be said to be Milesian. Analogues for the head include a group of terracottas attributed by F. Croissant to Miletos: two in London (British Museum 205, British Museum 206), one in Athens (National Archaeological Museum 5669), and one in Paris (Louvre MNC 681),18 which show a similar emphasis on horizontality in the design and placement of the features. The serene faces all communicate a sense of an immediate and living presence. Four marble heads, one from Miletos (Berlin, Staatliche Museen Sk 1631);19 one from Samos (Berlin, Staatliche Museen Sk 1874);20 one from Miletos(?) in Paris (Louvre Ma 4546);21 and another in Izmir (Archaeology Museum 15136)22 are similar in anatomical structure to 76.AO.77. The eyes of the tiny amber, though different by being hollow, are still distinctively alike in form.\nThe hairstyle appears to be unusual, but this may be owing to a paucity of comparisons. The curved lower contour is distinct from the common horizontal termination. Comparable coiffures on Greek kore figures include an early-sixth-century terracotta in London said to be from Tanagra; a marble kore from Andros in Copenhagen; a late-sixth-century bronze mirror stand in London (said to have been found in Rome); and a late-sixth-century (with later interventions) marble kore in New York, said to be from the neighborhood of Laurion.23 The hair of the Leto from Delos is slightly longer than that of 76.AO.77, but the bottom-edge contour is the same. This “pageboy” style is more frequently seen in Etruria on Middle Archaic votive bronzes (on both korai and kouroi) than among Greek Archaic korai. The most relevant examples include the Middle Archaic korai in Florence (Museo Archeologico Nazionale 266 and 231), and an unnumbered bronze in the Villa Giulia, Rome.24 The Etruscan absorption of this style may help to locate where the 76.AO.77 was carved.\nWho is represented in 76.AO.77? It is hypothesized here that the amber represents a goddess. The material of the pendant and the crown determine its divine identity. If the figure represents an Olympian, Artemis, Leto, Aphrodite, and Eos would be possibilities. Each one is a brilliant goddess associated with light. However, details of the hairstyle and dress, and the South Ionian or even more specifically Milesian style may preclude any identification other than Artemis or Leto. The veil and hairstyle, and perhaps the breast jewelry, are significant.\nAlthough there is disagreement among scholars about the meaning of the veils worn by kore figures, they are generally agreed to be of considerable significance. Since, as Brunilde Ridgway summarizes, the kore type originated “probably as a divine image … heavily indebted to Oriental prototypes, both in rendering and in items of clothing … [which was] further exploited to portray specific goddesses, usually by the addition of an attribute or extra garment,”25 the context, the attributes, and the details of dress are all important. For Ridgway, the late-sixth-century marble Leto found in the Delian temple of Artemis (Athens, National Archaeological Museum 22)26 raised questions about the interpretation of all East Greek and Samian veiled korai, and she came to the conclusion that the veil drawn over the head must imply more than regional fashions, that it\n must at least stand for matronly status or even outdoors versus indoor attire.… Even strict dependence upon Oriental religious iconography would not ensure a similar divine identification for all of [them] … [but the] possibility however exists, and we should be open to it since we have too easily extended to all female figures that generic meaning of agalma which, to be sure, applies to many of them. 27\n Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones summarizes the evidence for veiling in Greece and shows the multivalency of the veil\u0026rsquo;s meanings, including their place in the social order.28 He reviews the complex range of the Greek terms for veil and the difficulty of matching them up with their artistic counterparts. Nevertheless, it is tempting to identify the veil of 76.AO.77 as the delicate and glistening ampekhonē.29\nBesides the veil, the marble Leto from Delos wears another distinctive element, a double chain ornament (which once supported six pendants) that attaches the two veil lappets together like an old-fashioned sweater chain. 76.AO.77 wears a single, pendantless ornament across the breast. Is it attached to the garment or does it secure the two lappets? In the final argument, Ridgway identified National Museum 22 as Leto, partly because of the veil, and partly because of the marble female figure found with it, which she identified as Artemis. (There is no comparable jewelry on the smaller marble.)\nThe hair of National Museum 22 is worn long and, like that of 76.AO.77, is curved at the bottom and, as noted above, is not common in Greek sculpture, being more frequently seen in Archaic Etruscan small bronzes. This, and the formulaic rendering of the skirt of 76.AO.77, may aid in further situating the amber and even help to identify which divinity is represented.\nThe formula of representing a chiton skirt of fine fabric drawn into near parallel folds is found on many marble representations of South Ionian female figures, standing and seated; examples are a votive relief and a fragmentary torso from Miletos.30\nThis is very similar to the patterning of horizontal folds found on Etruscan kore figures (even on figures with the feet placed close together). Two key parallels for the chiton skirt of 76.AO.77 are the Etruscan veil-wearers in Emeline Richardson\u0026rsquo;s Tomba del Barone group of bronzes, and a superb “Ionian” bronze kore from Rimini in Copenhagen.31 A very similar presentation of the chiton skirt is found on a number of sixth-century Etruscan (Caeretan?) gold plaquettes of korai, with three said to come from Ceverteri and one from Palestrina.32 The divinities (since they are crowned and made from gold, they must be divinities)33 fill the rectangular aediculae of the plaquettes, and in the London pair, the slope-sided hats overlap the edge. The gold figures wear diadems with colored glass paste inserts and the London pair each wears a necklace from which hangs a large inlaid pendant. The conical hats of the Etruscan examples are critical for the figures\u0026rsquo; identification: are they Artemis?34 These Etruscan objects are further evidence of the impact of South Ionian artisans in Etruria, perhaps the same ateliers responsible for 76.AO.77 and the other extant amber korai and kouroi, including the Novi Pazar ambers.\nThe chiton grasping is a significant gesture of 76.AO.77 and all other korai figures and is a subject of considerable discussion. Helmut Kyrieleis has established the point that sculpted korai may represent movement in stasis (and not lose their essential meaning) in the way that a running or hunting Artemis painted on a Greek vase can communicate violent movement.35 Read as if it were an Egyptian image, 76.AO.77 (and related images) are represented in a pose frozen at the most important or recognizable part of a ceremony, which can only be understood “in terms of the meaning of the larger ritual in which it was embedded.”36 For the tiny amber korai, is the pose frozen in running or dancing, specifically cultic and ritual dance? If the dance, lines from the Homeric hymn to Artemis might be recalled,\n this huntress who delights in arrows slackens her supple bow and goes to the great house of her dear brother Phoebus Apollo, to the rich land of Delphi, there to order the lovely dance of the Muses and Graces. There she hangs up her curved bow and her arrows, and heads and leads the dances, gracefully arrayed. 37\n The active pose, the “attributes” of transparent clothing, veil, crown, and chain, long loose hair, and the material of 76.AO.77 suggest that the tiny pendant represents specifically Artemis or Leto. Given that, Leto, like her daughter Artemis, is a birth goddess, and the age-old association between amber and childbirth, it is likely that 76.AO.77 and her kin served as special ornaments, ones with fertility aspects, either in direct magic, or as powerful danger-averting amulets. The clinging transparent clothing and the position of the figure\u0026rsquo;s hand on the skirt both emphasize the pubic area, the location of the primary sex characteristic. This composition is comparable to the Egyptian manner of representing elite adult female fertility figures in the cases where nudity was inappropriate.38 A fertility subject represented in a substance associated with fertility would enhance the meaning of the object since subject and material are inextricably intertwined in all ancient amulets. Here, the subject might well function as did its Egyptian counterparts, the fertility figures linking the process of giving birth in this world with that of being reborn into the next. If 76.AO.77 and the amber animals were originally buried together, the group might be compared to the more complex precious metal plaques from the eastern Mediterranean, such as the numerous multisubject Rhodian plaques (seventh century),39 or a work like the semicircular gold plaque (Island Greek work) from Ayd1n (Tralles) of circa 600 B.C.40 The most complex of the Rhodian ornaments include female figures (clothed or nude), human heads, animals and animal masks, pomegranate blossoms and other flowers, or solar symbols. A winged Potnia Theron with felines and a centaur grasping a fawn are also common subjects. The Ayd1n pendant is among the most elaborate compositions: the female figure is in the “mastery of the animals” pose; she is joined by griffin\u0026rsquo;s, bull\u0026rsquo;s, and ram\u0026rsquo;s heads and nonfigural solar imagery.\nMuch remains to be understood about the origin, meaning, and function of the large-scale kouroi and korai, but it appears that these sculptural types could serve both as votives and in funerary roles, to represent a divinity, a heroized dead person, or idealized youth. Both kore and kouros could be a pleasing offering, an agalma.41 Furnished with suitable attributes, the kore or the kouros could become a hero or divinity, the Dioskouroi, Apollo, or Athena, for example.42 While much has been written about the life-size and larger korai and kouroi, there is a relative paucity of discussion about the miniatures.43\n76.AO.77 and the other amber korai may have served for the living as well as for the dead, in body adornment, as amulet and ornament, roles that the large-scale objects were never called upon to play. The compact format of the pendants, the incorporation of suspension devices or plate bases into their designs, and the occasional evidence of use wear (rubbed surfaces as on the Novi Pazar and Berlin korai), replacement of suspension holes (as might be argued for the Novi Pazar korai), or enlargement of the stringing holes (as on the Basel kore) suggest a significant use in life (or lives) before interment with the deceased. The ultimate “user” actually may have been the deceased. These tiny korai also may have been gifts and thus part of the funerary rituals. For the works that show no signs of wear, it is possible that a pendant was made expressly, or acquired especially, for setting on the body or placement in the grave at the time of burial. In death, the amber korai might have provided aid and protection during the fraught journey to the afterworld, if the beliefs attendant on such uses were current in Italy, as they had been for millennia in Egypt.\nNotes   The term kore, commonly used for the many kinds of images of Archaic standing draped females, is misleading but useful.

If the objects were perforated to hang feet upward and head downward, the orientation may have been purposely danger-averting, as it makes reference to the underworld (the opposite, or mirror world of the dead). Alternatively, the orientation may allude to the nocturnal rather than the just the diurnal phases of the sun or moon, that is, to their complete passage. ↩ For Berlin, Staatliche Museen 1851: Citation: Richter 1968Richter, G.

As Llewellyn-Jones 2003 outlines, the outer garment could denote stages in a woman\u0026rsquo;s life cycle and appears to have played various social and symbolic roles throughout Greek culture. In Homeric epic, noblewomen (and in notable cases their serving women), the focus of the cycles, wear the veil, and in seventh-century painting, goddesses (Athena and Aphrodite) and well-born wives (Eriphyle and Helen) are depicted with various types of outergarments worn over the head. A girl\u0026rsquo;s passage to womanhood was marked by her use of the veil; she offered her veil to Artemis on the eve of her wedding (when the bride comes under the protection of Aphrodite) before donning a special matrimonial veil; and as a married woman she wore a veil in public, going without it only in the first stages of mourning. ↩ Might the veil of the amber kore be the ampekhonē (or ampekhonon), the fine, expensive outer garment, most probably a veil, noted in antiquity for its delicacy and semitransparency?

In this regard we might also ask, What was the role of the tiny bronze sheet kouros figures on the Etruscan chariot from Monteleone in New York (Metropolitan Museum 03.21.1, Rogers Fund, 1903)? ↩ Perhaps something of the Egyptian approach to the minuscule was retained in the tiny korai and kouroi images, especially when they are made of high-status, magical materials.

Paul Getty Museum, 1982.\nCondition The amber is fragmentary: a large section of the left side of the head, the neck, and a portion of the back of the pendant were broken off at some remote time, as is suggested by the weathering. Overall, the surface is worn and grainy but not friable. The surface is covered by a yellow-orange crust that obscures the underlying red-orange amber. There are new chips in several areas, especially along the edges, that have exposed glassy amber below. In natural light, the piece is opaque and yellowish brown. At the new breaks, which expose the interior, it is red-orange. It is not translucent under artificial light, and it is impossible to see if there are any inclusions. There is a stopped bore on the back of the head, and just below the right ear is a stopped bore with a plug of amber still inside it.\nDescription This is a fragmentary and weathered object. What remains is the head and neck of a female figure. The brow is short, and the cheeks are modeled and full. The large, almond-shaped eyes have narrow rims. The nose is eroded, but its general form is still evident: it is triangular, short, and relatively narrow through the nares. The mouth is wider than the nose. The jaw area is wide. The hair at the brow is dressed in a wave pattern. In front of the right ear is a large coil of hair. The rest of the figure\u0026rsquo;s hair is covered with a veil.\nThere is no surviving suspension device. However, the groove at the break on the left side of the head, and the groove and break on the underside of the neck, are likely two sides of a triangular suspension system.\nDiscussion 82.AO.161.6 was donated along with a large and varied group of amber beads and pendants about which little is known.\nThis fragment is unlike any other figured carved amber. Because of the odd break at the bottom of the piece and the remains of a triangular perforation system, it is proposed here that 82.AO.161.6 is the upper part of a standing figure and not a head-pendant. The three holes would have allowed the sculpture to hang upright. A number of other figured ambers from Italy, or said to be from Italy, and dating to between the seventh and fifth centuries were perforated for stringing in a similar manner.1 The best parallel is another fragmentary amber pendant in a London private collection, which represents a seated woman and child. It dates to the mid-seventh century and was probably carved at Vetulonia.\nThe figure of 82.AO.161.6 is similar in physiognomic type and dress to a group of sixth-century marbles from Ionia, from the area of Samos, Miletos, and Didyma. The telling comparisons are (1) a small marble head of a kore from Miletos(?) in Paris; (2) the statue of Dionysermos in the Louvre (Samos? Miletos?); (3) two votive reliefs of standing women in aediculae from Miletos in Berlin; and (4) the fragmentary figures from the column bases found near the temple of Apollo at Didyma, also in Berlin.2\nThe amber, like the marbles, has a similarly wide face with full, round cheeks, high cheekbones, slightly sunken areas at the lower edge of the eyes, and almond-shaped eyes. Those of the amber appear to be larger, but the shape and tilt are the same. The position of the veil on 82.AO.161.6, behind the brow-framing waves, is the same as that of the Louvre kore and Berlin column base heads. The amber and the Didyma marbles have in common another detail of hairdressing, the thick curl of hair in front of the ears. The latter firmly places 82.AO.161.6 in the same sculptural tradition as that of the Louvre and Berlin marbles and aids in establishing a terminus post quem. The long veil of 82.AO.161.6 is also characteristic of South Ionian kore figures, as described in the catalogue entry above. This is the same long veil intimated by the presentations of the Getty amber pendant of a female, Citation: 77.AO.81.25Cat. no. 26 (cat. no. 26).\nNotes   Citation: 77.AO.81.12Cat. no. 52 (cat. no. 52) is a significant example of a pendant with multiple perforations. ↩ For the Milesian kore head (Louvre Ma 4546): Citation: Hamiaux 1992Hamiaux, M.

From the beginning, they appear to follow a much older convention, whereby one part of a figure is sufficient to represent the whole. The symbolic meaning of the detached head as a pendant varies according to its type and use, but the head always represents a demon, hero, or divinity.\nIn this catalogue, I refer to this type as “head-pendants.” These can be divided into four basic schemata: a frontal face that is plain on the reverse; a complete head (the neck or a part of the neck is included, and the pendants are made to hang frontally); a frontal head with the neck included, but a plain reverse side; and the profile head with the neck included, the reverse plain, and the pendant made to hang in profile. Female subjects (humans or anthromorphs) with dressed hair, ornaments, or head coverings, and satyrs are found in all four schemata. Heads of indeterminate sex (probably representing youths or sphinxes), Herakles in a lionskin helmet, and bearded male heads with human ears occur only in the form of a frontal face with no neck, like a mask, the strongest form of the facing head motif.1 This is also the case with the rarely represented gorgoneion, the frontal face that precedes the appearance of the whole Gorgon in ancient art.2\nAll head-pendants of Greece and ancient Italy used in adornment have ancient small-scale antecedents in the art of Egypt, the greater Near East, including the Syro-Phoenician area, and the Aegean, as well as in the image making of Ice Age Europe. The antecedents are of the utmost significance for the amber head-pendant: it should be seen as a late manifestation of a millennia-old tradition of wearing miniature decapitated heads, or heads pars pro toto, made in materials of high value on the head, around the neck, or on the upper torso (and much more rarely elsewhere on the body).\nThe earliest surviving head-pendants in amber date to the late eighth century, but they became more widespread during the second half of the sixth century, the same period in which the subject of a detached head was popular in other media, from architectural decoration to vessels and coinage. The format of the earliest documented en face amber head-pendant is very like that of the earliest Sumerian and Egyptian detached heads. The Sumerian profile heads used in inlays (various materials) date concurrently with the earliest Sumerian ornament-amulets in the form of frontal heads and faces. The frontal heads are in two basic types, those without horns (identified as goddesses) and those with bull horns (identified as gods). The earliest Egyptian amulets in the form of detached heads are flat-backed, front-facing heads and are exclusive to the late Old Kingdom and the First Intermediate period. Carol Andrews summarizes their appearance: short beard, prominent ears, and a suspension projection on the top of the head; and predominately of cornelian. They are “intended to give its wearer the use of the senses in general.”3 Related to this type is another: human-head scaraboids current from the New Kingdom onward. The enhancement of the scarab—the amulet par excellence of new life, regeneration, and resurrection—with a human face augmented its properties.4 Mycenaean objects with detached heads include engraved gems and metal vessels. A signal Minoan work is the bead in the shape of a human head in the Jewel fresco at Knossos.5 The heads of female and male figures made of faïence (glazed composition) from Apadana, Mari, and other sites in Mesopotamia dating to the late second millennium must have had great influence on the development of the head-pendant as ornament and amulet.6\nAntecedents for the amber head-pendants from Etruscan tombs are the protomes embossed in North Syrian metalwork, such as those on the bronze paterae and cups interred in the Barberini Tomb at Praeneste (those on the cups are winged);7 the faces of possibly Syro-Palestinian Tridacna squamosa shell figure-vessels, alabaster and stone cosmetic palettes, and ostrich-egg and other Oriental oinochoai;8 the human heads on Etruscan bucchero vessels with relief decoration;9 and the two types of ivory faces from the Barberini Tomb (the bearded faces and the single, perhaps female face).10\nThe female heads on some late-eighth-century Cretan and Cycladic gold objects may be the direct ancestors of the earliest amber head-pendants. These include the frontal heads attached to a crescent-shaped gold pendant from the Khaniale Tekke Tomb from near Knossos,11 and three gold “buttons’” from a tomb at Megara (and a related pendant from Naxos in Berlin).12 Contemporary with these gold ornaments are the earliest surviving amber head-pendants: a pair of indeterminate sex from the sacred deposit at the temple of Artemis at Ephesus, and three undocumented faces from Italy (perhaps Vetulonia): that of a youthful female(?) figure whose hair is braided back from the brow; an unbearded, helmeted figure; and a female divinity (possibly) who wears an elaborate bird headdress.13\nThe next generation of frontal heads and faces includes the numerous seventh-century precious-metal objects made in East Greece and Etruria. These include objects where the face is the single image, and others on which the face or detached head is one of many. Two objects exemplify the pervasiveness of this imagery: a pair of Etruscan armlets from Vetulonia, where the two terminal registers are made up of trios of faces (perhaps those of sphinxes), and an electrum temple pendant from Cameiros, a complex work that includes two frontal heads at the top.14 Numerous bone and ivory protomes from East Greece and Sparta date to this period.15 Although they are not independent works, the amber faces set into ivory and bone reliefs—a Laconian ivory sphinx and a pair of Laconian winged fertility divinities, flanked by smaller figures—should be mentioned.16 The detached female heads protecting a number of sanctuary-dedicated Greek bronze vessels of the seventh century are related in both subject and function:17 the female protective goddess represented on a vessel support from Olympia18 is probably the same divinity as the one gazing outward from the Rhodian metalwork19 and the early ambers. In addition, noteworthy seventh-century analogues for the gold, ivory, and amber heads are those represented in early electrum coinage.20\nAlthough there are many instances of detached heads in seventh-century art, especially in East Greece, Crete, and Etruria, the subject was more widespread during the next century. The prominence of the detached head in Etruscan imagery, such as the so-called Canopic heads on the “metopes” of Caeretan dolii, or terracotta architectural decorations (on antefixes and raking simas), indicate the significance of the subject.21\nThe importance of the detached head in early-sixth-century Italy is indicated by the variety of materials in which it is found, the range of its use, and its geographic distribution.22 The amber head-pendants of the sixth century gained currency at the same time that the subject was more frequently employed in other media: in Greek vase painting; in early Greek facing head coinage;23 on contemporary gemstones; as precious metal adornment worn directly on the body (as on a necklace)24 or attached to dress, or ritual headgear;25 as an attachment on bronze vessels; in architecture, as antefixes and on the raking sima; as the subject of terracotta votives; and for small votive(?) bronzes.26 A key amber of this period is the early-sixth-century amber head of a female figure wearing a slope-sided hat (a siren or sphinx) excavated from an amber-rich grave, Tomb 96 at Chiaromonte-Sotto la Croce.27\nFurther study of the female heads on Etruscan Orientalizing metal reliefs and Etruscan bucchero, and on Greek and Etruscan vessels, thymiateria, and lamps;28 as well as of the bearded male heads and demonic figures of “Phoenician” glass pendants—and their relationship to the early amber heads from Italy—should reveal a related purpose and iconography. They all must represent danger-averting divinities, heroes, and fantastic beings.\nAmber head-pendants of the second half of the sixth century were made during a period of considerable amber availability in Italy, but most are small, from 10 to 50 mm. Notable examples are the six female faces from a tomb at Eretum: a frontal head-pendant of a woman from Certosa; two frontal female head-pendants from Tomb 102 at Braida di Vaglio (Basilicata); the Getty Head of a Female Divinity or Sphinx (76.AO.85.1); and two heads (possibly female) in the Louvre.29 The earliest of the profile amber head-pendants date to the second half of the sixth century. From this point onward, until their virtual disappearance in the last quarter of the fourth century, female subject head-pendants in both profile and frontal format coexist.\nJust after the mid-sixth century, the first male head-pendants appear, first satyrs (in both facing and profile formats) and then, a few decades later, faces of the Cypriote-type Herakles and a type of unbearded males with human ears. The latter two types are uncommon. There are no male heads with bull’s horns, a not uncommon subject in other media.30 The earliest examples of satyr-subject head-pendants are the Getty Head of a Satyr ( Citation: 82.AO.161.1Cat. no. 13, cat. no. 13) and a trio (found together) in a New York private collection.31 The satyr-subject head-pendants precede ambers representing full-bodied Bacchic revelers (perhaps all satyrs) by at least a decade, if not more, in the early fifth century, and continue to be a popular subject until the early fourth century, when figured ambers ceased to be made. From their earliest appearance in Greek art, and enduring in popularity throughout late antiquity, satyr heads were considered especially efficacious in averting danger, evil, and particularly the evil eye.32 In Italy and in Etruria especially, they were frequently employed as antefixes, often coupled with female heads, usually identified as maenads. Satyrs, in Etruscan art of the sixth century and onward, were present in sacrifice scenes, and, as Jean-René Jannot points out, it is not clear whether this alludes to a cult of Dionysos or to one of nature more generally.33\nThe other identifiable male subjects of head-pendants include the unbearded Herakles in a lionskin helmet. Other male types are images of bearded males with naturalistically shaped ears, and a number of unbearded faces of indeterminate sex that seem to represent youths. The latter, though nameless, probably represent heroes or divinities appropriate to the material of amber. Apollo is a good candidate; the god was worshipped as the Averter of Evil (Greek: Alexikakos, Apotropaios), the Protector (Epikourios), and the Purifier (Katharsios).34\nEye size varies among the earliest head-pendants of the seventh and sixth centuries: in some the eyes are naturalistically scaled; in others they are huge, staring, and rimmed with heavy lids. From the fifth century onward, large, “old-fashioned” staring eyes are the norm for both profile and frontal head-pendants, with the exception of a few classes, notably one attributed to Canosa and another to Campania.\nFrom their earliest appearance, female head-pendants wear their hair elaborately dressed. In addition, they wear one or more kinds of head decoration or covering, sometimes in complex combinations: bands, crowns, caps, hats (various styles of poloi and various cone-shaped styles), a kekryphalos, or kerchief, wrappings made from strips of cloth (sometimes over hats), and veils or other drapery-type head coverings. Not only are the facial types and artistic styles diverse, the grooming and adornments also differ. Headgear, hairstyles, and jewelry vary, and the ambers in the Getty collection include most of these variants. A number of the female head-pendants, in various kinds of dress, are carved with a wing or wings. Among the earliest is a large profile head, Citation: 76.AO.85.2Cat. no. 15 (cat. no. 15). The winged head-pendants vary in type. Some, such as Citation: 76.AO.85.2Cat. no. 15, represent a youthful female. Others, such as Citation: 77.AO.81.5Cat. no. 23 (cat. no. 23), represent a heavier-faced, mature, and unsmiling type.\nMost amber female head-pendants wear headgear in the Archaic Ionian Greek or Etruscan fashion, as most modern students of the material have commented. The figures are dressed in the manner of the elite—sometimes they are clearly divine or heroic figures, sometimes actual persons; in other cases, they represent persons in ritual roles as votives, celebrants, and offerants. Parallels are found in Greek, Campanian, and Etruscan art (for both style and dress), and the dress and style of the figures represented in the head-pendants are comparable to those of the women painted in Etruscan tombs and on vases; molded in relief on Etruscan bucchero or terracotta antefixes; engraved on Etruscan mirrors; or made into small bronzes, many of which are votives.\nThe findspot and context of only a small percentage of the hundreds of facing and profile amber heads that have come to light since the nineteenth century are documented, and of these, even fewer were excavated under controlled conditions. Seventh-century examples are few but are recorded as coming from sanctuaries where they were dedicated to the Greek divinities Aphrodite, Artemis, and Apollo Daphnephoros. The recorded examples of sixth-to-fourth-century date almost all came from female grave contexts (those of women or children), and in only one case from an Italic sanctuary, that of the goddess Mefite (a goddess with kourotrophic and chthonic powers), who is identified with Aphrodite/Venus.35\nThe identities of the various female figures represented in the amber head-pendants are still an open question. A number of proposals have been put forward, all with the apparent assumption that in every case, similar-looking heads represent the same being. A female goddess, a protective genius, or a maenad—these are some of the hypothesized identifications.36\nIn the view of this author, amber head-pendants represent a variety of beings, including divinities, supernaturals, and demons, and the identities are not fixed. The material of the head-pendants, the amber, seems to preclude identifying them as images of their owners, or even of mortal mourners. Although it is unlikely that the head-pendants represent votives, supplicants, or offerants—identifications often made for related figures in other media, such as Etruscan bronzes—it is still possible that they may do so in light of ethnographic analogies. Amber female head-pendants were made over centuries and descend from different iconographic types. The same image type may have been used to represent different beings, depending on the circumstances. In the case of buried heirlooms or prestige gifts, it is possible that a treasured piece may have had several owners and even different identities over time.\nRoger Moorey’s recent words about the identity of terracotta idols are pertinent to this vexing issue. In his Schweich lectures, he proposed that anthropological research\n in the first place highlights the fact that figures of similar appearance may have represented different beings, natural or supernatural; that the same type of figurine might have multiple functions, and that in one assemblage the same type might have had more than one function. In the second place, it indicates that terracotta anthropomorphic figurines do not have to conform to the tendency to regard them as necessarily representative of supernatural beings\u0026hellip; . They may have embodied aspects of \u0026gt; prevailing ideologies, whilst also reflecting contemporary society by encoding a variety of ritually significant knowledge relevant to the world of man and nature\u0026hellip; . in light of ethnographic analogies \u0026hellip; clay figurines do not have to conform to our expectations for them to be representations of supernatural beings or forces rather than of living human beings acting as votaries or worshippers or perhaps of dead human beings as ancestors or ghosts.37\n Attributes may have modified the basic types into more individualized representations. The addition of a wing or wings, a diadem, or a necklace might signal an aspect of divinity or demon and act as a determinant. Just as is the case with votive terracotta heads, the types might be adjusted by additions or adjustments. Identical terracotta votives may in one circumstance represent the offerant, in another, the divinity, and in still others, both at the same time—since the gods were represented in human form.\nThat the amber head-pendants are made from a potent material traditionally employed for divine, demonic, and heroic subjects, a material valued for its protective, apotropaic, and regenerative aspects, seems to limit the range of possible identities to certain female divinities; nymphs; protective geniuses; guides or psychopomps; demonic anthromorphs such as a sphinx or siren; spirits or souls; and, possibly, magical subjects like Medea or Circe.\nWhat is critical is how these head-pendants might “work.” The bodiless heads and faces were pars pro toto of the full body, and thus held special power. A head alone could convey the hieratic implications of the complete body. The facing head and the frontal eye—an excerpt of the facing head—were highly potent foci and functioned apotropaically.38 The glaring eye, guarding against danger and averting evil with its “terrifying gaze” (phobon blepon), underscores the protective role of the image.39 The number of head-pendants with large (disfiguring) holes in the faces may be critical evidence for one kind of use and identity. It is possible that they were disfigured by drilling in order to nullify the possible negative powers of the image.40\nThe identifiable pendants of Herakles are of the Cypriot type and underline the renowned potency of the immortal hero divinity: Herakles is a savior and a healer, a protector of springs, and a danger-averting deity (in Etruria, his close connection with Uni clearly establishes him thus). In each of the amber Herakles heads, he is frontal and wears the skin of a lion, a symbol of his strength, prowess, and deadly force. His glaring eyes emphasize his affinity with wild and dangerous fauna: he could be deinon paptainein (terrible to behold). In the one instance where the context of the Herakles head-pendant is known, its figured amber counterpart is a satyr, servant of Dionysos.41 This juxtaposition of ambers parallels the subjects of the main gate at Thasos, Herakles on one side with drawn bow and Dionysos on the other with the thyrsos.42 The two dangerous gods acted as guardians of the city.\nAn electron amulet of Apollo might well connect his fiery missiles with amber’s solar origin. With Herakles and Artemis, Apollo’s twin, the three bow-bearing gods were, for good and ill, death dealing. The divine twins were sharp shooters in their murder of Niobe’s children; the twin gods could also deliver peaceful deaths to the elderly.43 What better all-around amulet than one that could protect, ward off death and danger, promise rebirth, and heal? (Apollo’s son is Asclepius; fiery amber could function sympathetically to ward off fever; Apollo is one of the deities powerful both for the living and the dead.)\nThe dual natures of deities like Herakles and Dionysos, or Artemis and Apollo, are often played up in their iconography: their power to protect is directly related to their powers of destruction. In Italy, and in Etruscan religion, the deities powerful for this life, the transition to the afterworld, and the afterlife itself were critical to funerary imagery. A special role was reserved for those deities with light and rebirth aspects. Erika Simon illuminates this eloquently: “Thus also the Etruscans wished their dead to have light. They gave them amulets with astral symbols and painted the holy laurel grove of Apulu/Usil on the walls of their tombs.”44\nNotes   The origins of the facing head must lie in the efficacy of the severed \u0026gt; heads of real animals positioned as trophies in public or cultic places. In P. Erhart Mottahedeh’s view Citation: Mottahedeh 1979Erhart Mottahedeh, P.E. The Development of the Facing Head Motif on Greek Coins and Its Relation to Classical Art. New York, 1979., pp. 274–75,\n there exists no better vehicle for conveying hieratic and demonic associations. Deity and demon alike were most powerful and impressive if encountered face to face, and in pictorial art only the facing head allowed direct confrontation between image and viewer. The facing head was, in effect, the pictorial equivalent of the cult image in the round. It could express more ably than the profile head the presence or actuality of deity or demon, for immediacy was potency. From earliest times the facing head motif reveals a fundamental duality and polarity in art; it exhibits, so to speak, two faces—one hieratic and godly, the other demonic and monstrous. Opposed to the profile head, it can assume either a positive or a negative role signifying good or evil, sacred or profane and similar polarities. This duality and polarity of the facing head motif was engendered by ancient religious beliefs in an elemental godhead which combined polarities—one both threatening and protective, beautiful and monstrous, fertile and barren.\n She continues, “Its strongest form is the Mask, which is able to capture essence alone, undiluted by activity\u0026hellip; . The motif was initially reserved for highly symbolic figures\u0026hellip; . For human figures it served to strengthen divine nature, while for certain animals and hybrid creatures it served to underscore demonic force.” For other discussions of the mask form and its apotropaic role, see the sources listed in Citation: Mottahedeh 1979Erhart Mottahedeh, P.E.

Winter, Greek Architectural Terracottas from the Prehistoric to the End of the Archaic Period (Oxford, 1993), pp. 62–63, reiterates, albeit with skepticism, the proposal by M. Torelli (“Terrecotte architettoniche arcaiche da Gravisca e una nota a Plinio,” NH XXXV, 151–52, Nuovi Quaderni dell’Istituto di Archeologia dell’Università di Perugia 1 [1979]: 307–8) that two Cretan immigrants to Italy invented antefixes decorated with heads. F. Kenfield, in his review of Winter (Bryn Mawr Classical Review 94.11.05), finds the Cretan-origin hypothesis attractive. On the subject of identity and meaning, Winter proposes that female-headed antefixes represent sphinxes. Kenfield calls attention to M. Mertens-Horn, “Una nuova antefissa a testa femminile da Akrai ed alcune considerazioni sulle Ninfe di Sicilia,” [[BdA]] 66 (1991): 9–28, where she proposes an alternative interpretation specific to Sicilian female head antefixes. Kenfield suggests, “Female head antefixes could have different meanings in different places.” The same is possible for the female amber head-pendants, and for comparable reasons. The metope-stamped dolii include a right-facing bearded male head, but no female heads or other female subjects, as L. Pieraccini makes clear in “A Storage Vase for Life: The Caeretan Dolio and Its Decorative Elements,” in Etruscan Italy: Etruscan Influences on the Civilizations of Italy from Antiquity to the Modern Era, ed.

The hairstyle of 23471 b is comparable to that of contemporary sphinxes, such as that of the sphinx on an Etruscan gold fibula from Vulci in Munich (Antikensammlungen 2338): Citation: Cristofani and Martelli 1983Cristofani, M., and M. Martelli, eds. L\u0026rsquo;Oro degli Etruschi. Novara, 1983., pp. 183, 296–97, no. 171. ↩ It is significant that there are no extant amber head-pendants of male figures with horns, considering how popular the subject of a horned, bearded male figure is in pre-Roman art, in gold work and ivory, and as a device on early coinage. This lack is even more surprising given the existence of four complete amber pendants in the form of recumbent bull-bodied, bull-horned anthromorphs, one in London (British Museum 68 [“Achelous?”]), another in Paris (Louvre Bj 2123), a third in New York (a pendant in the Metropolitan Museum of Art [ 1992.11.57 , Purchase, Renée and Robert A. Belfer Philanthropic Foundation, Patti Cadby Birch, and The Joseph Rosen Foundation Inc. Gifts, and Harris Brisbane Dick Fund, 1992]), and a fourth in a Geneva private collection. The style of the four taurine ambers is Ionian influenced; they have few comparanda apart from East Greek plastic vessels in the form of similar creatures. The full-body anthromorph types derive from the ancient Near Eastern bull-man and are often identified as Achelous (whose realm, as first stated in Hesiod’s Theogony, is streams and water), but which could be identified as Eridanos. Their antecedent is the human-headed bison, or bull-creature, that was associated with the sun-god Shamash; it is linked with the eastern sunrise. Since amber has both solar and aqueous associations (ocean, river, and stream), these amber pendants, which follow a millennia-old compositional format, may incorporate both the ancient Near Eastern solar associations and the watery ones. The four amber bull-men pendants revert their heads and were perforated to hang head downward. Does this pose connect them to funerary use? On the early human-headed bison, or bull-man, see P. Hansen in Citation: First Cities 2003Aruz, J., with R. Wallenfels, eds. Art of the First Cities: The Third Millennium B.C. from the Mediterranean to the Indus. Exh. cat.

Paul Getty Museum, 1976.\nCondition The two sections were acquired as separate objects by the donor and accessioned as such into the museum. After entry into the collection, it was discovered that the two joined and composed one object. Before the donor purchased the pieces, they were cleaned to remove dirt and some encrustation. At the museum, the surfaces were treated with an amber oil distillate, which made both pieces relatively more translucent but also darker. There are no visible inclusions in either section. The front of the face section, 76.AO.85.1 and 76.AO.86, is in fair condition; it is covered with minute cracks and some chips, and the tip of the nose and a section of the right cheek are broken off. The back of the rear section, 76.AO.86, is in good condition. It retains a high polish on the exterior surface but is marked by opaque spots and tiny fissures, and there is a small loss on the left side. The interior surfaces of both sections are in good condition, with the exception of a small chip at the edge of the inside of the back section. Degraded amber is found in the abrasion scratches of both insides. In ambient light, the amber of 76.AO.85.1 and 76.AO.86 is a deep reddish orange; in transmitted light, it is more transparent and a brighter orange. 76.AO.86 is dark red under strong light and almost opaque in ambient light.\nDescription The two parts of the head were joined after accessioning into the collection. When joined, the frontal aspect is an exaggerated egg-shaped oval, widest across the forehead, curved at the headdress, and almost pointed at the chin. In side view, the amber is a flattened oval. The wide forehead is arched at the top, with the brow line mirroring the jawline; the chin is small and pointed, protruding forward to the level of the zygomatic arches. The under-chin area is cut inward. Positioned so that the plane of the two joined sections is perpendicular to the ground, the face tilts slightly forward, the forehead is in front, and the chin is regressed toward the neck. In this orientation, the eyes appear to be downcast. There is a sharp cessation of the design at the back of the front section. Above the forehead is an ornament, a crown or ornamental band. It is decorated with a pattern of pinnate-shaped sections, or rays, in two levels. It emerges above a narrow fringe of hair, which is divided in the center and rendered by closely spaced vertical striations. The volute-shaped ears are high on the head, nearly parallel to the back plane, but so close to the head ornament that they seem to be attached to it. The mass of the hair is dressed in beaded tresses, like cornrows, which run in a rostrocaudal direction, the rows separated by closely engraved lines intersected by even more finely engraved ones.\nThe eye cavities are empty and flat, and likely once held inlays. The eye sockets are carved with an elongated sinuous opening, the outer canthi of each eye higher than the inner canthi. The eyes extend from the frontal plane around to the sides so that in side view the eyes look hooded. The nose is indented at the bridge, with the line of the nose inclined at a modest angle away from the face. The corners of the mouth abut the inside curve of the cheeks, and both lips are pulled tightly upward (the upper overhanging the lower): this makes the mouth into a full smile. Since the mouth is recessed from the main facial plane, the effect of a prominent chin is increased, which also emphasizes the smile.\nTool marks or polishing abrasions are evident on the inner surfaces of both halves and just behind the ears on the face. The two sections fit together perfectly. There is no evidence of an adhesive.\nDiscussion The lack of a suspension perforation, the high polish of front and back sides, and the sharp cessation of the hair at the circumference suggest that the two sections of 76.AO.85.1 and 76.AO.86 were fitted into a metal bezel, ring mount, or another, similar kind of setting. Light would have shone through it, and the large “drop” of amber would have glittered, marvelous to behold.\nThis amber has no exact parallel in style or form. It was likely unearthed in Italy and may have been made there, but the style is that of East Greece. 76.AO.86 is remarkably close to a group of terracottas put together by François Croissant, which he named H Group, Knidos(?).1 Croissant linked the group to two of his Samian subgroups, Type A1 and Type A5, hypothesizing that a foreigner (a Knidian?) produced these terracottas in a Samian atelier. In comparison to the protomes of Croissant\u0026rsquo;s H Group, 76.AO.86 has a similar facial structure—the same triangular form, eyebrow placement, wide and high arc of the brow edge, and the sharp angle of the jawline and a similarly shaped nose, recessed mouth, tucked-in lower lip, and prominent chin. 76.AO.86 has many features in common with Samian and other South Ionian works. Among them are (1) the ivory “Artemis” from the Halos deposit at Delphi;2 (2) a marble head from Miletos in Berlin (Staatliche Museen Sk 1631);3 (3) the over-life-size marble kouros from Samos now in Istanbul;4 (4) a bronze horseman from the Heraion at Samos;5 a bronze statuette of a woman from Samos; 6 and (5) three black-figured Samian female head kantharoi, one from Vulci and a pair from Chiusi.7 The potters of these kantharoi have exploited the open shape of the vessels, resulting in wide, heart-shaped faces, an exaggeration of the facial type of the amber, the comparanda above, and also of another Getty head ( Citation: 83.AO.202.12Cat. no. 21, cat. no. 21).\nWho or what is represented in this amber? The physiognomy suggests that the subject is female. Because of the material, the type of head ornament, and the bright smile, it is hypothesized here that the Head represents a divinity or a sphinx, as must the crowned amber head-pendant of a female subject in London (British Museum 57).8 The crown of 76.AO.86 is similar to the headdresses of some of the ivory and bone images of Artemis Orthia from the Spartan sanctuary,9 to the feathered crown worn by the female divinity of the Laconian Grächwil krater (Artemis? Potnia Theron?),10 and to some of the headdresses worn by many of the female heads on the handles of Laconian hydriae.11 (The relationship of these headdresses to those of Hathor and Bes in Egyptian and Phoenician art may be more than a visual similarity).12\nThe crowns and smiles of the tiny female divinities (Potnia Theron, Artemis, or her Etruscan counterpart?) embellishing a number of sixth-century Etruscan (Caeretan?) gold ornaments are important comparisons for 76.AO.86, not only for the identity of the amber, but also because of the East Greek connection of the gold working.13 An earlier Greek parallel for this Head’s crown is the headdress worn by a seventh-century ivory sphinx from Perachora.14 In turn, the Perachoran ivory\u0026rsquo;s crown might be seen as a latter-day, schematic version of a Mycenaean fashion—such as those sported by the intensely smiling pair of sphinxes on an ivory lid from Mycenae, or the head ornament worn by the sphinx on an ivory from the Athenian Acropolis.15\nIf 76.AO.86 were mounted in a bezel, the mounts may have resembled the earlier oval ring mounts (of gold, silver, or gilt-silver) of a special class of seventh-century pendants, some of them scaraboids. Excavated examples include silver-mounted ambers from mid-seventh-century graves at Cumae, Veii, and a gold one from Vulci.16 Three other hypothetical options for the setting of 76.AO.86, two Etruscan and one Egyptian, are the embossed gold *aedicula*–cradle mounts bent around three Egyptian faïence pataikos/dwarf amulets for a necklace buried in a tomb at Vulci;17 the embossed strip mount bent around a broken amber (for use as a pendant);18 and the Egyptian gold settings for royal heart amulets and heart scarabs of precious nephrite.19 However, while the silhouette of the Egyptian pendants is almost identical to that of 76.AO.86, the stones are flat on the reverse, not rounded like the amber.\nNotes   Citation: Croissant 1983Croissant, F.

The resemblance of the statuette to the Getty Head is enhanced by the similarly empty eye sockets. Comparable also are the structure of the head, the arch of the forehead, the head width (from ear to ear), the smile and placement of lips, and the upward tilting and general shape of the eyes, although there are differences—the nose is more prominent, and the chin more recessed—reasons why Croissant placed this bronze in his Ch. 5 Phocaean(?) group. ↩ The head kantharoi, both of male and female subjects, provide revealing parallels.

III), there are many others in collections both old (New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art) and new (the Getty Museum). There is the remote possibility that the mounting may have been of amber on the basis of one known parallel: one of the possibly male heads (686/1) from the Novi Pazar, St. Peter\u0026rsquo;s church, find was originally set into an oval amber frame, which is now lost but known from photographs. There is a notch cut above the right ear, but no perforations.

Paul Getty Museum, 1976.\nCondition There are no visible inclusions. The overall condition is good; the surface is firm and stable, although an extensive crack network is visible in transmitted light. There are small chips above the left eyebrow, near the left eye, and on the left side of the hair that join to form a fine diagonal crack; there are tiny losses on the right cheek and right ear. There are small chips and losses on the back of the object. It is red-brown and opaque in ambient light and bright orange in transmitted light. The metal insertions (wire or pins?) in the top of the head are broken off; one is rectangular in cross section. (They have not been scientifically analyzed but appear to be of silver.)\nDescription The amber is convex on the obverse; the reverse is a smooth and curved so that in profile to right, the back is C-shaped. Only the front of the head is depicted, that is, the face and the front part of the hair. The eyebrow ridges lie flat on the surface of the face; the upward curves are slight (the left somewhat more curved than the right), with a delicately suggested transition to the root of the nose. The shallow, feather-shaped eye sockets (which may have been intended for inlay) incline sharply upward at the upper corners. The lids are indented at the inner canthus, swelling above the eyes with the lids overhanging the lower rims. The area under the lower lid is sensitively modeled around the shape of the eye itself. The cheeks are full, especially around the mouth area.\nThe head\u0026rsquo;s facial features are not precisely symmetrical: the right eye turns up more at the outer canthus, its inclination more manifest, while the nose lists slightly to the right, its right nostril higher. The smallish nose sits close to the frontal vertical plane of the face. Straight and tipped upward, the wings of the nose are somewhat fleshy with the nares clearly defined. The mask has bow-shaped lips, the upper one overlapping the lower one, that are slightly pointed at the center, and the corners of the mouth are tucked in, to create the impression of a slight smile. The mentolabial sulcus is deep. The chin is wide and rounded, jutting forward to the plane of the brow. In full-face view, the ears are hardly noticeable, but in side view, they are clearly defined. They are large and placed high on the head. The antihelices are indicated, the antitraguses not indicated, and the lobes are separate.\nThe back is less polished than the front. There are traces of abrasion around the circumference and on the reverse. The individual strands of hair were cut with a graver. There are the remains of three metal inserts (silver?) in the top of the head, the central one larger than the two flanking it, and the residue of a green (bronze) corrosion product on the reverse.\nDiscussion 76.AO.79 has no exact parallel. No conclusion may be drawn about the sex, function, or the identity of the figure. It is not drilled for suspension nor is there a mount; it has a curved back; and the green (bronze?) corrosion product on the reverse appears to be the result of direct contact with metal. The metal inserts in the top of the head are placed in the position of a crown, and although a suspension device could have been incorporated, there is no apparent parallel for this method.\n76.AO.79 was accessioned as the head of a girl and published in 1993 by this author as that of a male divinity. If this latter identification holds true, the divinity could be Apollo. The sexing of the head now seems less sure; it may be that the original designation was the correct one. If, indeed, 76.AO.79 represents a female figure, the amber may represent a “brilliant” divinity such as Artemis or Aphrodite, the Potnia Theron, or perhaps a beautiful sphinx.\nIn form, 76.AO.79 is related to the previous catalogue entry, 76.AO.86. They both have curved backs, although that of 76.AO.79 is curved on one plane only and is not rounded. The one other carved amber head-pendant that has a similar curved back is a female head-pendant in Munich.1 It, too, has no visible boring for suspension; instead, the Munich head has a metal (bronze?) suspension loop (of uncertain date) inserted in the top of the amber.\nThe purpose of the three metal (silver?) inserts in 76.AO.79 may have been to suspend the head, but since there are three, two small and one large, it is more likely that they are the remains of a crown, or other head decoration (silver would suit such an ornament).2 Although unlikely, an incorporated suspension loop should not be ruled out. The only parallel for such added decoration is a head-pendant of a female figure (a siren?) in London (British Museum 60), said to be from Armento and probably dating to the mid-fifth century. Metal remains (silver? Wire or pin?) are in the lateral suspension boring, and further remains are in a larger vertical boring in the top of the head.3\nThe curved back of 76.AO.79 and the green residue on it make difficult a hypothetical reconstruction of any support. Other contemporary mounted scarabs, amber scaraboids, or gemstones have characteristically flat backs. It is possible that the head was fitted with a gold bezel, comparable to the way that an Etruscan mounted three Egyptian faïence pataikos figures for a necklace.4 However, the corrosion product on the back of 76.AO.79 suggests it was in direct contact with bronze. If set into bronze, the support would have had to fit the curve of the amber\u0026rsquo;s back. (Could it have been set into the base of a vessel handle?).5 All other extant amber faces used as inlay are flat on the back, and all are mounted in amber, ivory, or bone.6\nIf the mounting of the Munich pendant is original, when suspended against a flat surface, the head would appear to look upward; however if it were the single pendant of a carrier and worn high on the neck at the jugular notch, the amber would have fit snugly into the depression and the mask would look straight out. There are many Archaic illustrations of figures male and female wearing simple necklaces with one (or a few pendants) at this position or even higher up, as a choker. Might the same be true of 76.AO.79?\nFor the style of the head, the best comparison for 76.AO.79 among amber carvings is the Getty amber kore pendant Citation: 76.AO.77Cat. no. 8 (cat. no. 8), which is attributed to a South Ionian carver. Both compare well with a number of Archaic East Greek sculptures in terracotta and marble, especially those from the ambient of Miletos. 76.AO.79 shares the general stylistic qualities of the Milesian school—the frontality, the horizontality, the solidity, the “Massigkeit”—as outlined by François Croissant. He convincingly demonstrated that there are two great artistic tendencies in Milesian sculpture, a “style graphique” and a “style pictoral.”7 It is within this latter trend, within the naturalistic vein of Milesian art, that 76.AO.79 seems to find its proper berth.\n76.AO.79 can be linked to specific Milesian works, especially the terracotta protomes of Croissant\u0026rsquo;s Type B3–B6 series.8 They have in common a relatively flat face, the nose at a low angle relative to the cheeks, a short and overlapping upper lip, and a short, squarish chin. The amber head also compares well with a number of marbles from East Greece: the head of a draped woman from near Ephesus in London (British Museum B89); a siren in Copenhagen, from near Cyzicus; the head of a sphinx from Keramos, in Izmir; and the Louvre Dionysermos.9 The Keramos marble is closest. The head shape, the plastic transitions from area to area, the sweet smile, the air of quiet self-confidence, and the composition of the features are very alike. The relation of the eyes to the eyebrow arcs is the same.\nThe eye shape is a distinguishing feature of the amber. The eyes of 76.AO.79 are akin to those of many of the terracottas in Croissant\u0026rsquo;s Samian and Milesian groups, South Ionian marbles, and the Getty amber Kore, but the best parallel is the large ivory “Artemis” from the Halos deposit at Delphi.10 Her distinctive eyes are feather-shaped, turned up at the outer corners, swelling in the center, with the lids stretched over the orbit and the upper lid overhanging the lower and drooping slightly. (Those of 76.AO.79 turn up more sharply, are spaced further apart, and are even narrower and smaller in proportion to the face.) This affinity is noteworthy not only because it establishes a stylistic connection between the amber and ivory but also because it offers further evidence for the argument that amber carvers worked ivory and vice versa.\nThe hair of 76.AO.79 is elaborately dressed: the front sections of the hair are combed forward, apparently secured by a band, and then flipped back toward the crown, forming a series of curved bunches of hair framing the head. The hair sections just above the ears take the form of so-called Ionian wings. Although the hairstyle may have originated in Ionia, it was quickly absorbed in western Greece and in Etruria. Variants are worn by male and female figures in the Archaic period. Such hairstyles are found on the female figures (both heads and caryatids) of a group of terracotta lamps from Magna Graecia, a type that likely originated in the Achaean cities of the Ionian coast, but which was further developed in the colonies of Magna Graecia.11 The hairstyle of 76.AO.79 is analogous to those worn by certain sirens and sphinxes. The hair of the marble siren from Cyzicus (Milesian work?) in Copenhagen, as well as that of a number of stone Etruscan sphinxes from Vulci and the sphinxes of a gold fibula from Vulci in Munich, allows the possibility that 76.AO.79 represents an Etrusco-Ionian version of the fantastic creatures.\nAn exotic comparison is the Tridacna squamosa shell made into a female figure (siren?) by a Syro-Phoenician(?) artisan, an example in the British Museum excavated at Vulci.12 The face carved into the shell\u0026rsquo;s umbo is very like that of 76.AO.79.\nThe comparisons presented above point to a date for the head in the period of circa 550–520 B.C. and to a skilled carver from East Greece, perhaps in Etruria, where the impact of artisans from South Ionia and elsewhere in the east had such impact on art in the second half of the sixth century. Whether 76.AO.79 was originally the inlay (face) of a figure in another material or the centerpiece of a pendant, the amber itself determines that the subject of the head was a divine or heroic figure, a supernatural, or a demonic being. The metal attachments, if they are part of a headdress and of silver, do not allow another interpretation.13 As Brunilde Ridgway has argued, the very presence of elaborate head decorations in Archaic art “serves to indicate superhuman or divine beings.”14 As she concludes, “The metal attachments on the heads of Archaic statues should be read as part of elaborate headdresses functioning as attributes and helping in the identification of the figures.”15\nIf the head represents a siren or a sphinx, 76.AO.79 would be another example in amber of the liminal creatures. Whether their images were worn in life or in the grave, the “work” of these creatures was established: they were effective in protection and aversion, and in the journey to the afterworld, both were reputed guides. Both have regenerative aspects. If 76.AO.79 is the head of a female divinity, it may be the image of Artemis or another deity with solar aspects. Then again, if it represents a youthful male divinity, the amber head may denote Apollo. The head, as a glittering object in the form of a divine or demonic being carved with the greatest skill and detail in high-status materials, amber, silver, and perhaps ivory for the eyes, was worthy of the attention of the gods; it is, it was, a marvel to behold. The materials, the image, the exquisite craftsmanship, all were worthy of the gods\u0026rsquo; attention. During the funerary rituals, and in the tomb, 76.AO.79 could have played a small but important role. A shining tear crafted into the form of a beautiful, youthful face was surely appropriate as a funerary gift, especially if the deceased had died young.16 If the figure is Apollo, it might have brought to mind the stories connecting the solar material, the solar deity, and the mourning by the sun-god for the premature death of Phaethon and Asclepius.\nNotes   Munich, Antikensammlungen 15.003. ↩ See cat. no. 10, n. 18 and n. 19, for discussion of amber pendants in metal mounts. ↩ Citation: Strong 1966Strong, D. E. Catalogue of the Carved Amber in the Department of the Greek and Roman Antiquities. London, 1966., p. 74, no. 60, pl. XXIV.

Paul Getty Museum, 1983.\nCondition Small sections in the hair at the front top and reverse of the head are broken off. The amber surface is in poor condition, with an extensive network of cracking and loss, mostly on the reverse. The surface is fragile, with many loose flakes; some surface flake losses are 1 mm deep. Before the pendant entered the Getty Museum, the surface was treated with a surface consolidant, likely in an attempt to strengthen it. (This probably contributed to the overall cracking pattern, causing further surface deterioration and shrinkage.) In ambient light, the pendant is light to dark brown, with some areas of translucency. In the places where modern chips have exposed the interior, it is dark orange and translucent. In transmitted light, the amber is bright red-orange. There are various inclusions.\nDescription The pendant is a large piece of amber, relatively flat on the reverse and rounded on the obverse. It represents the head and partial neck of a satyr in profile, facing right. The short, rounded forehead is modeled with a brow ridge and an eyefold in a manner close to the appearance of a human. The almond-shaped eye is plastically modeled, following the curve of the head. The eyeball area is recessed from the upper and lower lids. The lids are represented as filletlike lines and are of equal thickness. The upper lid line is more arched than the lower one, and overlaps it at the outer canthus. The short, upturned nose is deeply indented at the root, rounded at the tip, and includes carefully modeled wings and nares. Rather small in proportion to the rest of the face, the long, teardrop-shaped ear is plastically modeled; the tip is acute.\nA long mustache begins just under the nose. It is articulated with sweeping engraved lines, curving at the upper part and more horizontal below. The mustache overlaps the beard. The beard juts forward and ends in a rounded point. Closely engraved lines, straighter in front and more curved at the jaw, represent the beard hairs. A shallow ridge marks it off clearly from both the face and neck. Just below the lower lip of the small mouth is carved a small patch of beard.\nIn front of the ear and surrounding the face are two rows of hair rolls, separated by a raised, filletlike line. At the forehead, the hair rolls bulge slightly, giving them the impression of volume. The lines defining the hairs in the bangs section are curved, the upper ones tilting slightly to the right and the lower ones slightly to the left. Behind the top row is another raised line, perhaps a fillet, defining the rolls from the crown portion of the hair. The cap of the hair is plain and follows the shape of the amber nodule to suggest the form of the skull. An engraved line separates it from the hair at the back of the head. The sweep of hair is modeled, with the midsection the most prominent. It is defined with nine horizontal rows separated by parallel curving grooves. Each of the rows is further described by short, finely engraved lines, giving the impression of coils of tightly curled hair pulled into a low-hanging bun. The neck is long and smooth and connects to a tiny section of the shoulder.\nThe idiosyncratic form of the pendant suggests that the carver closely followed the natural shape of the cleaned piece of amber. The head and neck are skillfully adapted to the surface\u0026rsquo;s irregularities. On the obverse is an indentation at the top of the head and a shallow groove at the top of the beard line on the cheek, and on the reverse, a long smoothed groove at the back of the head. There are no visible tool marks because of the severe cupping of the surface.\nIn the break are the remains of a shallow, drilled groove, all that is left of the suspension perforation. There are four stopped bores: two on the obverse, one at the point where the beard meets the neck, another at the base of the ear, and two on the reverse, at the back of the head and at the neck. The two on the obverse retain their plugs (which are darker in color than the surrounding amber). When hung, the head would have fallen into position with the nose upward.\nDiscussion This is one of the largest and most finely worked of all extant figured pre-Roman ambers. It has no exact parallel. Satyrs are the second most common subjects of head-pendants and date from the late sixth to the late fourth century. This profile head-pendant of a satyr and the other head-pendant of a satyr in the Getty collection ( Citation: 82.AO.161.1Cat. no. 13, cat. no. 13) are among the earliest portrayals of the subject in amber. They are also the two most common types, the profile head-pendant and the frontal face. Only a trio of satyr heads in a New York private collection is earlier.1 The Getty and New York satyrs are of three different types and styles and reveal three different traditions of satyr illustration.\nThe two best comparisons for 83.AO.202.1 are the satyrs of two ambers in London: Satyr and Maenad (BM 35) and Vintaging Satyr (BM 36).2 Both British Museum satyrs have small noses and mouths similar to those of the Getty head-pendant, and both 83.AO.202.1 and one of the British Museum satyrs (BM 35) sport luxuriant, long mustaches and extremely neat beards of rather short and straight hair (vertically delineated), barbered in two tiers. The two figures\u0026rsquo; coiffures are also similar, typified by a full bang that is longer in front of the ears. The mustache of BM 36 is less full and shorter, his beard more pointed, his hair shorter, and instead of a plastically rendered eye, his is hollowed out and flat, as for an inlay.\nThe reverse or main side of BM 35 is a figural group that includes a dancing pair, a nude bearded male, and a draped female, with a young fawn leaping up between them; on the obverse is a large bearded snake, coiled and upright. The finial is a dolphin. BM 35 has been variously identified: Strong called it a satyr and maenad (even if the male figure does not have pointed ears, hooves, or a tail). It was formerly identified as Artemis and Zeus and as Artemis and a giant. In the view of this author, the main figures are better read as Bacchic revelers, with the male figure wearing the mask of Dionysos. The bearded snake may be a symbol of the spirit of the dead, or it may act as a chthonic symbol that refers to Dionysos (and perhaps Orphism). BM 36 represents a figure with normal ears (it is also hoofless and tailless), accompanied by a wineskin and grapes, crowded in the amber with a pointed amphora, a vine, and on the reverse, a coiled and rearing bearded serpent. The figure may represent a satyr, but it is more likely that he, too, is a Bacchic reveler wearing the mask of “the god, who does not appear.” The bearded coiled snake on the reverse may also refer to the chthonic Dionysos. For the initiated, the imagery of BM 36 may have conjured up Dionysos\u0026rsquo;s mythic vineyard on Naxos, the wine of which was divine and held the promise of eternal life.3 Reveling dancers are the subject of nine other carved amber pendants. Single male dancers ornament pendants in Boston and New York;4 single female dancers are the subject of many more pendants, including three from excavated graves in South Italy, one from Oliveto Citra and two from the Rutigliano-Purgatorio necropolis (one is armed).5 In addition to BM 35, a high-stepping couple is the subject of an amber pendant in the Louvre.6\nThe active pose of 83.AO.202.1 is demonstrated by the forward position of the head and neck as well as by the satyr\u0026rsquo;s hair, streaming out behind him. Parallels for the head position are numerous; it is characteristic of many Attic black-figure painters and is a hallmark of the Etruscan black-figure vase painter known as the Micali Painter. The Attic examples include the active satyrs on an aryballos by Nearchos; three dancing satyrs on an amphora in the manner of the Lysippides Painter (an aulos-playing satyr on side A and a pair on side B, where one crushes grapes and the other attempts an abduction of a nymph); the dancers on an amphora by the Painter of Cambridge 47; and the ithyphallic harvester on an Amasis Painter amphora.7 The beard and hair of 83.AO.202.1 are most similar to the satyrs of the Amasis Painter and the Micali Painter. The Etruscan master\u0026rsquo;s rendering of the hair and beards of his fast-moving ithyphallic satyrs—the dancing, aulos-playing, and running satyrs of Louvre CA 3185, the racers on his amphorae in Baltimore and Palermo, and those on the column krater in Berlin are especially similar.8\nEtruscan artisans working in bronze and in ivory refined the millennia-old manner of indicating fast movement—the stretching out of bodies with hair flying out behind. The rendering of the acrobats\u0026rsquo; hair on a tripod excavated at Vulci and the running figure of Perseus on a tripod foot from Orvieto are two outstanding parallels mirroring the speedy satyr of 83.AO.202.1.9 P. J. Riis has attributed these bronzes to his Group of the Mainz Censer, the earliest one of which he describes as “Late Ionizing (Late Ripe Archaic) or early Late Archaic.” The motif is current in ivory and bone carvings of male figures engaged in strenuous activities: driving chariots, wrestling, or fighting sea monsters.10\nMany of the descriptive details of 83.AO.202.1—the very fine striations of the hair and beard, the tongue of hair beneath the lower lip, and the form of the eye—draw it close to the design and cold working of a group of bronzes thought to be Northern Etruscan, perhaps Chiusine, from about 500–480: 1) a banqueter in London (British Museum GR 1831,1201.1); 2) the “Herakles” from Contarina (Rovigo); 3) the “Fufluns” in Modena; and 4) the Getty Statuette of Tinia.11 83.AO.202.1 is also very close to a group of Vulcian bronzes first brought together by Mario Del Chiaro (but which are for P. J. Riis part of his extended Mainz Censer group, as noted above).12 Del Chiaro\u0026rsquo;s group includes sirens, satyrs, and acrobats, in addition to the Cortona lamp.\n83.AO.202.1 and the two Dionysiac ambers in London, BM 35 and BM 36, are strikingly similar to the earliest pseudo-scarabs made in Italy. Donald Strong was the first to connect the figure of BM 36 with a cornelian in Boston,13 on the back of which is a splayed, bearded Dionysos that “immediately argues a close stylistic connection with a whole group of S. Italian ambers. Other examples of such pseudo-scarabs, a number of which are in the British Museum, exhibit several of the same characteristic elements of style.”14 Strong thought the group to be South Italian, very probably Campanian, especially BM 459, which is made of sard, with a siren on the scarab side and Apollo(?) on the flat.15 J. D. Beazley, writing earlier, was more cautious about the London sard: “The style of the stone may perhaps be called Etruscan rather than Greek. If it is Etruscan, it is one of the earliest Etruscan gems.”16 P. Zazoff, J. Boardman, and, most recently J. Spier have noted the key role of the Master of the Boston Dionysos (as he is now called) in the story of gem engraving in Etruria.17 Two silver objects from Lydian Usak have suggested to Spier a possible explanation for the immigrant master\u0026rsquo;s training in a specific East Greek atelier.18 Boardman\u0026rsquo;s latest thoughts on the gem cutter are relevant for 83.AO.202.1:\n Other gems by the same artist (Master of the Boston Dionysos) have their backs detailed in an “Etruscan” manner, and the style of the figures—stocky, big-headed, flat-footed in stance—is very close to that of peripheral Etruscan work in bronze and stone (as the Volterra stelai). This does not mean that the artist was not a Greek, since we may only be witnessing the establishment in Etruria of an immigrant and highly individual Greek style. But it is not one as yet well attested in the west so, whatever his nationality, the artist might be considered the first of the “Etruscan” gem engravers. There are later and still purely Greek works made in the west, which contributed to the development of the local studios. 19\n Was a gem engraver or bronze worker responsible for 83.AO.202.1, as might have been the case for earlier figured ambers? Was the head-pendant made in Vulci? Might it even have been made by the Master of the Boston Dionysos?\nIn spite of its state of preservation, this satyr is a striking object. The large size of the piece of amber and the exquisite artisanry of 83.AO.202.1 must have occasioned admiration from the day it was finished. In its function as an amulet, it may have been considered “homopoeic,” meaning that through assimilation it would endow the wearer with the subject\u0026rsquo;s characteristics, the swift and nimble satyr promising its owner fleetness of foot, the ability to speed away from danger or pain, as would a hare amulet. It may have been considered as especially lucky, the magic and potency of the image being enhanced by the material. Satyrs were apotropaic images that could work on the “like banishes like” principle. An “active” satyr could call up the god Dionysos, the dance, and the ceremonies of sacrifice. Tied on to the body, in life or in death, such an amulet could place the wearer under the protection of Dionysos.\nSince satyrs were not just useless hedonists but were also understood to be wise, “accomplished in dancing and in secret rites or initiations of Dionysos” (as described by Eustathios),20 and to be participants in religious ritual as servants of Dionysos (Strabo),21 the pendant may have been involved in related activities. Etruscan funerary rites were not complete without the dances of reanimation, which took place at the cremation or burial place. Dancing satyrs are endlessly depicted on vases found in tombs throughout Italy, notably in Archaic Etruria. On the Micali Painter\u0026rsquo;s famous vase of a funeral procession, satyrs figure prominently, dancing among veiled women, important insignia-bearing personages, and others. As Jean-René Jannot notes, the most archaic Etruscan illustrations of sacrifice “place very odd sacrificants in the scene: Sileni and satyrs, who impart a Dionysiac atmosphere, or at least invoke the savage character of the sacrificial act.”22\nIf the head-pendant were sufficient to represent the whole and the satyr was understood as dancing, the subject may have alluded to the ceremonies of the funeral and reanimation through death. If the satyr were abstracted from an activity such as vintaging, and the image understood to be a “quote,” the Getty Satyr could allude to Dionysos\u0026rsquo;s magic vineyard on Naxos. If the Satyr were completed as ithyphallic, the pendant may have called up the phallic aspect of Dionysiac religion, and the head-pendant could have alluded to Dionysos Oipholios. Then again, 83.AO.202.1 may have conjured up a specific episode in Dionysian myth—the arrival of Dionysos by sea, or the union of Dionysos and Ariadne. Certainly, the amber\u0026rsquo;s optical characteristics, recalling the rejuvenating sun, or the color and sparkle of wine, would have been especially apt in underlining an association with the divinity for one of Dionysos\u0026rsquo;s servants.\nThat 83.AO.202.1 is of amber, the golden “tear” of Phaethon\u0026rsquo;s mourning sisters transformed into poplars, may be of special relevance for this head-pendant. If the gloss in the late lexicon of Harpocration is to be believed, that those who were initiated into the “Bacchic rites” (Bakkhika) were crowned with a wreath of white poplar “because the tree is chthonic, and chthonic also is Dionysos, the son of Persephone,”23 what better material for an adherent to wear than Phaëthonic amber?\nNotes   Cyclops*, and to Eustathios on Homer\u0026rsquo;s Iliad 1.311.25.\n  Unpublished. ↩ The two in the British Museum are Citation: Strong 1966Strong, D.

Paul Getty Museum, 1982.\nCondition The piece is intact, although the surface condition is poor and the surface is covered by a thick, yellow alteration crust flaking over the entire surface. There are also many small chips on all sides. There is a large fissure on the top of the head and other smaller fissures on the reverse side. A whitish encrustation covers some areas. The amber is yellowish brown and opaque in ambient light, translucent and orange where the interior is exposed by modern breaks, and bright orange and generally translucent in transmitted light. There are inclusions, or deteriorated material, visible in the fissures.\nDescription This relatively large head is egg-shaped in front view and is like a rounded slab in profile view. It is slightly convex on the obverse, flat and plain on the reverse. Despite the poor condition of the piece, its subject is still legible. The hair is caplike, delineated by eleven rows of snail-like curls in even rows. The head is widest at the position of the ears. Traces of the right eyebrow remain; the brow itself is wide and smooth. The plastic, almond-shaped eyes are located equidistantly between the top of the head and the chin. The inner and outer corners (canthi) appear to be on the same line. Although broken, the ears are long, pointed, and prominent and set high up on the head. The cheeks are wide and flat and the face long. The remains of the nose suggest that it was small and short. The mouth area is small and surrounded by a short mustache and low, close-cropped beard.\nThere are two suspension perforations, a narrow gauge lateral bore through the top of the head and a second, larger, rostrocaudal hole in the center of the forehead. All four exits show enlargement at the upper parts, abrasion troughs, and chipping. There is a stopped bore in the top left of the head. When suspended from the lateral bore, the head hangs with the brow tipped forward and the chin recessed. Suspended from the large hole, the head hangs perpendicular to the ground. If the large hole were used to secure the head to a support, its chin would have been back, the top of the head forward.\nDiscussion The condition of this head—the evidence of pulling on the upper edges of the perforations, the frontal perforation that is likely secondary to the lateral bore, and the wear on the prominent surfaces of the head—suggests that it saw substantial use before it was buried. A number of pre-Roman figured ambers have a narrow gauge transverse perforation for stringing and one or more large front-to-back borings. Some have been found still attached to fibulae. Others retain only metal nails, or their traces (some bronze, others silver), perhaps used to attach the ambers onto a wood (or other material) support. There are other significant examples of figured ambers with both lateral direction narrow-bore perforations and larger front-to-back borings.1 They include a female head from Rutigliano still attached to a silver fibula, documented as from the early fifth century; a dancing figure from Oliveto Citra, which was first perforated with a transverse hole for suspension as a pendant, and then with five other front-to-back holes, one large one in the middle, and four slightly smaller holes surrounding it; a fragmentary female dancer (probably once joined by a male figure) in a New York private collection, which has a transverse perforation and four large holes with the remains of bronze rivets; two profile female head-pendants and a horse\u0026rsquo;s head on the London art market (perhaps from the same findspot) whose frontal holes still retain silver nails. In each case, the large rostrocaudal holes are disfiguring and appear to be secondary to the lateral suspension bores, which are worn from pulling, with characteristic abrasion troughs on the upper inside edges of the exits.\nThe Getty satyr\u0026rsquo;s head is illuminated by comparison with six female-subject head-pendants in the British Museum: BM 55, whose findspot is unknown, and five others bequeathed by Sir William Temple, which are said to have come from Armento (BM 54, 56, 57, 58, and 60).2 82.AO.161.1 is most like BM 57, a head of a female(?) figure wearing a feather crown.3 The London heads and this amber satyr have a distinctive softness in the modeling, especially in the planar transitions, which must have been accomplished by abrasion. This is contrasted with the outlining of the eyes, probably done with a use of a graver, and with the description of the hair, perhaps accomplished with a carving tool such as those used for ivory or wood. The visual effect is more like stone carving and the best of ivory working or fine woodworking, and less like that of gem engraving. Donald Strong suggested that the London head-pendants, though said to have been found at Armento, were very likely made in Campania or “under the strong influence of Campanian art of the sixth century BC.”4 A comparison of the London pendants to selected Campanian coroplastics bears out Strong\u0026rsquo;s observations.5 Marked, too, are the East Greek aspects of the 82.AO.161.1 and London group; this is highlighted when they are compared to East Greek sculpted and molded works, and to the most East Greek–looking of Etruscan bronzes and painted vases.6\n82.AO.161.1 has stylistic and iconographical features in common with 76.AO.85.1 and 76.AO.86, attributed to an East Greek, or East Greek-trained carver. Many of the comparanda important for 76.AO.85.1 and 76.AO.86 also elucidate 82.AO.161.1. In addition to these are coins and glyptics with frontal faces of Dionysos and his male followers. Three key comparisons are: the “satyr” of an early electrum hecte from Cyzicus;7 the device of a reclining satyr on an agate scarab in London, the name piece of the Master of the London Satyr, an East Greek carver working in Etruria;8 and the Dionysos wrapped around the back of the cornelian pseudo-scarab in Boston, the name piece of the Master of the Boston Dionysos.0 A number of satyr heads on Attic black-figure vases are also important comparanda for the above-listed images of satyrs in amber: the large and staring eyes and the carefully groomed hair and beards are but two of the striking similarities.9\nThe only other amber satyr head related in format and size to 82.AO.161.1 is a well-preserved pendant from Tomb 106 in the necropolis at Braida di Vaglio (Basilicata).10 Although the Braida amber differs in the satyr type, the face exhibits the same sober expression. The Braida satyr\u0026rsquo;s hair is deeply waved around the brow, his beard is long, and his large ears prominent. This is in contrast to the short beard, small ears, and curly hair of the Getty satyr. The context of the Braida satyr pendant is the early fifth century, but it must have been carved earlier, perhaps as early as the third quarter of the mid-sixth century. It also shows considerable use wear and secondary working. The face is especially worn on the prominent surfaces, and the inserted suspension loop in the top of the head is likely secondary to the narrow gauge lateral boring. The same British Museum heads presented above as comparisons for 82.AO.161.1 are also instructive for the Braida di Vaglio satyr, especially BM 56.\nFor a discussion of the iconography of a satyr in amber, see entry for Satyr Head in Profile ( Citation: 83.AO.202.1Cat. no. 12, cat. no. 12).\nNotes   This group is discussed in the introduction, n. 266. ↩ Citation: Strong 1966Strong, D.

Paul Getty Museum, 1977.\nCondition The piece is in a good state of preservation. The surface is smooth and firm, despite a number of recent as well as older (weathered) small breaks and chips. There are fissures extending from the apex of the headdress to the eye, and from under the eye to the corner of the mouth. All fissures and cracks contain yellow-ocher residue. The smoothing of the prominent surfaces (a wear pattern different from overall erosion); the patination covering some of the breaks, including the tip of the nose, the lower edge of the eye, and several places on the cheeks; and wear on the suspension perforations are likely evidence of use wear. The amber is opaque in ambient light and reddish in color. With transmitted illumination, the interior appears bright orange and is transparent. There is a cloudy inclusion (possibly bubbles) at the top of the headdress.\nDescription The shape of the pendant is nearly triangular. The obverse is rounded and the carving curves around the form of the amber except on the back, which is plain, but uneven in surface. The figure is wearing a conical cap, and over it a veil and another overgarment. She also wears a circular earring. No hair is showing. The face is set off from her neck by an indentation. Her eye is large and almond-shaped, and is set off from the plane of the face by a continuous filletlike line, which represents the eyelids. The nose follows the same plane as the brow, with only a slight indention for the root of the nose. The upper lip area is short, and the barlike lips are pulled into a smile. The lower lip is wider than the upper. The horizontal sulcus is shallow and the chin prominent. The under chin is fatty. The point of the chin extends forward, to the level of the tip of the nose. The neck is plump.\nThe uppermost layer of clothing, a shawl or top portion of a cloak, covers a conical hat and veil. The grooves parallel to the edge of the overgarment are perhaps its border or the imprint of the edge of the hat beneath. The veil\u0026rsquo;s front border is finished with a band, represented by fine parallel lines. Five soft, narrow grooves represent the fabric\u0026rsquo;s folds as it hits the shoulder area. A shallow indentation in the overgarment, at about the jawline, indicates a break in the fall of the fabric.\nWhen suspended, the head would have hung with the chin forward; an imaginary line drawn from the tip of the nose to the chin would have been perpendicular to the ground. The slope of the forehead and the slope of the chin would have been at approximately 60-degree and 120-degree angles to the perpendicular.\nOn the reverse is a deep groove, probably a cleaned fissure. A 3 mm perforation for suspension extends from the flat area on the bottom side of the pendant and exits at the deep cleft on the side of the headdress. There are two bores stopped with amber plugs: one is located on the upper part of the headdress, and a second, 3 mm in diameter and about 11 mm deep, is under the chin.\nDiscussion This head-pendant has no exact parallel. The pendant\u0026rsquo;s triangular shape is unique. The dress of the figure, however, is similar to that worn by Citation: 76.AO.85.2Cat. no. 15 (cat. no. 15). Moreover, there are several parallels for the physiognomic type and the style of the pendant. 77.AO.81.4 is related to a number of images of women from Samos and other Ionian centers of the third quarter of the sixth century. Although the comparison can only be made from an old photograph, 77.AO.81.4 is remarkably similar to a now lost (unfinished) head once in Berlin, which was uncovered in the Heraion at Samos.1 The pendant also is akin to a family of East Greek terracottas. Other pertinent parallels include two mid-sixth-century alabastra in Paris and London, and a half-figure statuette of the second half of the century in Copenhagen.2 Although the chin of 77.AO.81.4 is more prominent than that of the terracottas, their other morphological similarities are compelling.\nStill closer comparisons are to be found in Etruscan art. For the dress of 77.AO.81.4, the most striking parallel is the Etruscan votive bronze in Florence (Museo Archeologico Nazionale 277), which belongs to Emeline Richardson\u0026rsquo;s Tomba delle Barone group, one she characterizes by its Ionian associations. (Florence 277 is discussed in more detail in the entry for Citation: 76.AO.85.2Cat. no. 15). An amber head-pendant in London (British Museum 53) wears similar dress, although her veil is drawn more tightly in front and it forms stronger horizontal folds.3\nFor the style of 77.AO.81.4, other Etruscan small bronzes and bronze reliefs are instrumental in situating the amber. Three figures in one of the panels of the Loeb Cauldron C (Peleus, Thetis, and a female companion) are very similar in physiognomy and expression, although their eyes are smaller and their hairstyles different.4 Eight small bronzes are important comparisons for both the iconography and style of 77.AO.81.4. They are an Etruscan votive in Paris (Bibliothèque nationale, Cabinet des Médailles 204); the four bronze corner figures from the box of a carpentum, now dispersed between Perugia, Munich, and Paris;5 two “Latin” bronzes from Satricum in the Villa Giulia (Museo Nazionale Etrusco di Villa Giulia 10519, 10922); and a “Latin” bronze in the Bibliothèque nationale (BN 205).6 The Villa Giulia bronzes are distinguished by the fact that they wear the Ionian chiton properly understood (a rare feature; they are draped like the Samian sisters from the Genelaos dedication), and by the upright solar disk at the back of their heads. Emeline Richardson considers them images of the Mater Matuta, the goddess of daylight and a light bringer.7 The figure of BN 204 is unusually pretty and her unusual dress uncommonly delicate: she is wearing an unbelted chiton, and her hairstyle is otherwise unknown in the Middle Archaic period.8 The profiles of 77.AO.81.4 and BN 204 are so alike as to be from the same model, or to be products of the same ambient: the angle of the nose and the chin relative to the perpendicular is the same. BN 204 might even allow us to imagine how 77.AO.81.4 would have looked in full face, that is, wide through the temples with eyes slightly far apart and narrowing to the chin.\nWho or what might 77.AO.81.4 represent? She wears a large earring and an elaborate dress: cap, veil, and overgarment. Not one strand of hair is showing. At the least, this is the adornment of the elite. Does this indicate the figure\u0026rsquo;s maturity or outdoor activity?—two explanations offered for head coverings in Greek sculpture. On the other hand, does the dress indicate religious-political activity (for example, sacrifice or attendance at another ritual)? The material precludes that the representation is that of a mortal; it signals, rather, that the image is that of a heroic, divine, supernatural, or demonic being. If a divinity, then perhaps one whose powers were connected to the sun and to its regenerative powers. The Ionian dress and style of the head, too, may indicate something of its identity as well as saying something about who, where, and why 77.AO.81.4 was carved and used. The style and dress point to South Ionia, Etruria, and to “Latin” Etruscan imagery.\n77.AO.81.4 could represent a divinity of light, similar to the Latin Juno Licina or the dawn goddess Mater Matuta, both of which share some aspects of the Greek Artemis (perhaps in her guise as Artemis Phosphoros), notably midwifery. Since the dawn is also a potent symbol of new life, this may be a South Ionian Eos or the Etruscan Thesan. Two other alternatives are Artumes and the Latin Juno Gabina; Richardson records that bronzes of a “Latin” type, some of them wearing sun disks, have been found at Gabii, near the so-called temple of Juno Gabina.9 If, indeed, 77.AO.81.4 does represent a light and life divinity, one that might be called upon with some regularity for aid in childbirth, in protection, or in the care of young children, such an identity may help explain the use wear on the face of the pendant.\nNotes   Berlin, Staatliche Museen 1875: Citation: Richter 1968Richter, G.

Paul Getty Museum, 1976.\nCondition A piece broken off at the neck in modern times was reattached with an adhesive before the donor acquired it. There is evidence of ancient use wear on the prominent parts (cheeks, nose, head, chin, and wing) and abrasion troughs on the uppermost parts of the suspension perforations at the top of the head. (The weight of the pendant, gravity, movement, pulling, or other abrasive action caused the carrier to deepen or “saw” the holes.) Modern damage includes pitting on the neck and cheek and large fracture losses at the right profile edge, at the forehead, and in the front section of the hair. The surface of the amber is firm and stable although abraded slightly and crazed overall. Several large fissures (with inclusions and degraded material inside) run throughout the piece, and there are other small areas of inclusions throughout the pendant. In ambient light, the surface of the amber is dark red-brown and opaque; with transmitted light, the pendant is dark red and translucent.\nDescription The pendant depicts the head and neck of a female figure in profile facing to the right. It is rounded and decorated on the obverse, flat and plain on the reverse. The area around the eye is subtly modeled. Brow ridge, eye fold, and eye bag are all indicated. The spherical shape of the eye is suggested and set off from lids that are represented as raised lines. The cheeks are full, raised, and puffed; the face is smiling widely. The chin is full and rounded and the jawline is set off from the neck by a groove as well as modeling. The neck is plump.\nThe hair is visible at the brow and at the right side. At least five overlapping scalloped waves once framed the face; the remaining ones lie close to the head and are defined with finely engraved, parallel, curving lines. Horizontal indentations behind the ear area and a curved line at the bottom indicate the shape of the hair fall. The shape and bulk of the head covering shows that over a cap (the conical projection at the back of the head is its apex) is worn a veil and, over it, a shawl. The outermost layer of the headdress is banded with a pattern of finely engraved parallel lines, perhaps a decorative woven edge, or an addition.\nA striking feature of this piece is a large volutelike wing, projecting from the right top side of the head and curving back to the neck. Diagonal engraved lines at the top and back indicate secondary feathers. In front and below the wing are sections of hair, engraved with horizontal parallel lines; the mass of the hair is curved at the bottom.\nThe smoothed grooves and craters are likely the result of the clearing away of surface inclusions or fissures in the amber blank. The object incorporates the natural undulations of the amber, especially at the back and in the wing area.\nThe pendant has two through-bores for suspension: at the crown is a lateral perforation 2.5 mm in diameter with a hole in the front of the head, at the border of the head covering, and another in the top of the head. At the position of the ear is a large bore, 9 mm in diameter, which appears to have been made after the head-pendant was carved. There are also five stopped bores: the longest, 22 mm in length by 4 mm in diameter, begins under the chin, ascends vertically to the hairline, runs parallel to a long internal fissure, and does not retain a plug. Two other stopped bores, one of which retains its plug, are located on the forehead. The two others at the back of the head and on the reverse are without plugs. It is not possible to determine how this pendant would have hung because of the multiple through-bores.\nDiscussion One of the largest of extant amber head-pendants, 76.AO.85.2 has no close counterpart. It is also significant within the corpus of head-pendants because of its style, iconography, evidence of use wear and quality.\nThe figure wears several elements of dress that cover her head: a cap, veil, and shawl or mantle. In this, the combination is comparable to the dress worn by Citation: 77.AO.81.4Cat. no. 14 (cat. no. 14). For the dress, the best parallel is an Etruscan bronze in Florence (Museo Archeologico Nazionale 277).1 The outer garments worn by Florence 277 and 76.AO.85.2 both display a decorated band on the front edge. Emeline Richardson noted the unusual style of the bronze figure, her unique banded scarf, and compared the work to a group of Greek-Ionian–looking bronzes, her Tomba del Barone group, named after the eponymous Tarquinian tomb. Richardson dated Florence 277 to the end of the sixth century. The hairstyle, however, is different from that worn by most other Archaic Etruscan human-form figures. It is one found on a number of Greek marble korai figures, sirens, and sphinxes, and is comparable to that of a unique image, possibly Etruscan, possibly Magna Graecian, of a bronze of a crowned and curiously robed figure from Covignano (Rimini), Villa Ruffi, now in Copenhagen.2\nThere is a distinct “Greekness” about the physiognomy and style of 76.AO.85.2. This is brought out by comparison to three different marbles: a small head of a sphinx from Aegina in Athens;3 a kore head from Lindos in Copenhagen;4 and a small kouros (unfinished) from Paros in Paris.5 There are especially striking correspondences between the Paris kouros and 76.AO.85.2: the full cheeks, which extend all the way from the angle of the mouth in front to the edge of the jaw, the form, and depth of the nasolabial furrows, the placement of the eyes, and the hair framing the face. These Archaic marbles date to the second half of the sixth century, with the Paros kouros close to the mid-century mark and the female heads in the later sixth century.6\nThe hairstyle of 76.AO.85.2, a complex fashioning of overlapping rounded waves, is an ancient one, first found in the Near East for gods and kings and refashioned in early Archaic art for male and female figures, as well as for sphinxes.\n76.AO.85.2 may be the earliest extant representation of a winged amber head-pendant. The wing—growing or attached behind the ear—implies the existence of a symmetrically placed ear on the other side of the head. This is not the only amber head-pendant to have a wing: a number of heads have a wing or wings. 76.AO.85.2 offers the opportunity to consider how the carver of the amber would address the concept of the head and wings of a winged divinity.\nThe choice to represent one wing or a pair must have depended on the form of the amber blank. For obvious technical reasons, wings projecting upward from the shoulders would be difficult to represent convincingly. Certain forms inherent in the undulating forms of the raw material might even have provided inspiration for the images: the rounded volute wing of 76.AO.85.2 may have started out as a natural high point on the resin. Other winged amber head-pendants are a pair from the Tomb of the Ambers, Ruvo (Naples);7 a head-pendant in profile to right, with one clearly represented wing, from an amber-rich grave of the Rutigliano-Purgatorio necropolis;8 a fragmentary head-pendant of a female frontal head with one wing in New York;9 two others in the Getty collection, Citation: 77.AO.81.5Cat. no. 23 (cat. no. 23) and Citation: 77.AO.81.29Cat. no. 16 (cat. no. 16); a large frontal head with two wings in the Steinhardt collection, New York;10 and three unpublished examples in a London private collection. Many of these winged heads are closely related in artistic style and in manner of dress to other, wingless amber head-pendants.\nThe wing might well be an attribute of the head, which acts as pars pro toto of a divinity, demigoddess, or demon. The winged head might be considered the sculptural compression of a complete winged figure.\nThe large and disfiguring frontal hole in 76.AO.85.2 was bored through the ear and surrounding area. As noted in the introduction and in the “Pendants in the Form of the Human Head” section, such large holes are found on a number of other figured ambers, of both male and female subjects, of complete figures as well as of both frontal and profile head-pendants, including satyr head-pendants, female head-pendants, a dancing female, a pair of sirens, a horse\u0026rsquo;s head–pendant, and a head of Herakles in a lionskin headdress.11 Was this pendant formerly attached to a fibula, as is the case with a head-pendant excavated at Villalfonsina (Chieti) and the two pins with amber heads threaded on them from Rutigliano, a satyr head on a silver pin and a female head on a bronze pin?12\n76.AO.85.2, like the large profile head-pendant of a satyr, Citation: 83.AO.202.1Cat. no. 12 (cat. no. 12), has four stopped bores, a plug retained in one of them. Were they part of the original production or made later? All the physical evidence, the smoothed prominent surfaces13 (this is not the typical breakdown of the cortex from oxidation), the multiple through-bores, the abrasion troughs, and the central hole, indicates that this pendant must have been used over a period of time before its final interment. The inherent evidence of 76.AO.85.2 suggests that it served as an important amulet-ornament for the living, long before it was finally placed in a grave, perhaps pinned on to the funereal dress of a girl or woman, in protection and in “mourning attending the young.”14 The wing, the old-fashioned coiffure, the Etruscan dress, and the style suggest that it was made in an Etruscan ambient where a Greek (perhaps Parian or Greco-Etruscan) artisanal tradition was significant.\nNotes   Citation: Richardson 1983Richardson, E.

Paul Getty Museum, 1977.\nCondition The piece is largely intact, except for a large loss at the top proper right of the pendant. The lateral suspension perforation passes through two fissures and is broken off at the top of the left exit. There is wide-interval cracking and crazing over the entire surface. Degraded amber residue, yellow ocher in color, covers parts of the surface and is inside the cracks. In ambient light, the piece is opaque and dark reddish brown; with transmitted light, it is translucent and red. There are no visible inclusions.\nDescription This head-pendant of a female figure includes the head and neck, which are contorted and abbreviated to fit the natural shape of the amber blank. The pendant is rounded on the obverse and nearly flat on the reverse, which is undecorated. The composition is asymmetrical: the figure is more deformed on her right side and more naturalistic on her left. The woman\u0026rsquo;s face is round but relatively lean. The high forehead is flat and smooth, and her brow ridge is modeled. She has full, wide cheekbones, shallow cheeks, and a small, pointed chin. The eyes are small and deep-set, with the orbits plastically rendered. The eyelids are indicated by engraved lines. The outer corners of the eyes turn up slightly. The nose is indented at the bridge and its tip is missing. The lips curve up slightly; below them is an indentation representing the mentolabial sulcus. The area below the chin is flat. The junction of the neck is higher than the point of the chin.\nThe headdress, a conical hat with veil, or perhaps a cloth-wrapped hat, sits directly on the forehead and is separated from the smooth brow by an engraved line. No hair shows on the forehead. Four horizontal grooves and a finer horizontal engraved line suggest the layers or wrapping of the headdress. On the upper left side of the figure\u0026rsquo;s head is a volute-shaped wing. At the side of the neck is a long, narrow segment of undifferentiated amber, which is set off from the neck by a long groove. It probably represents a long single hank of hair.\nThe suspension perforation is drilled in the upper part of the headdress and is 6 mm in diameter at its widest point.\nDiscussion Both the iconography and the style of this amber are Etruscan. The rounded, almost egg-shaped head is that of Emeline Richardson\u0026rsquo;s Middle Archaic korai, which she dates to the third quarter of the sixth century. What Richardson has proposed about this series of bronzes might also describe 77.AO.81.29: “The longest axis [is] from crown to chin, at an angle to the vertical.”1 The best parallels for 77.AO.81.29 among this Richardson grouping are bronzes in Florence from the votive deposit of Fonte Veneziana, Arezzo, including Museo Archeologico Nazionale 258, 265, 266, and 267.2\n77.AO.81.29 belongs to a family of amber head-pendants that are characterized by their sharp features—wide cheekbones, thin cheeks, pointed chins—vestigial necks, single locks of hair hanging down, and high headdresses. 77.AO.81.29 is a relative of the oldest-looking head from Tomb 106 at Banzi. The latter is one of a group of thirteen pendants, of different types and styles, from a grave dated to the second half of the fifth century.3\nNotes   Citation: Richardson 1983Richardson, E. H.

Paul Getty Museum, 1982.\nCondition The pendant is intact, but there are losses on the head and at the suspension perforation exit on the back of the head. The front perforation exit is smoothly worn on its upper edge, suggesting pulling. Details are smoothed at the tip of the cap on the obverse and at the middle of the pendant\u0026rsquo;s back more than elsewhere, probably through use. The opaque brown surface reflects the original surface level visible on the cheek and jaw. The surface is crazed, and extensive flaking and cracking all over the surface reveals a reddish, sugary, translucent sublayer. In ambient light, the amber is yellow-brown. At the modern breaks, the interior is translucent and bright orange. In transmitted light, the pendant is translucent and dark red. There are no visible inclusions.\nDescription This pendant is oblong, its obverse slightly convex, and its reverse flat and plain. 82.AO.161.3 represents the head and neck of a female in profile. The forehead is broad and rounded. The large, almond-shaped eye is plastic, bulging out almost as in nature; it is recessed at the corners. The lids are rendered as shallow grooves with slightly curved upper and lower rims of varying thickness. Above the eye is the eyebrow ridge, which continues into the temple area. A longer and deeper groove extends from the inner canthus of the eye to the chin, a combination of the nasolabial line and the mouth furrow. The nose is indented at the root. The ears are smooth, rounded shapes at the angle of the jaw; the right ear is more legible than the left. The area between the nose and upper lip is short. The upper lip slightly overhangs the lower. The mentolabial sulcus is a shallow curve. Although the chin is prominent, it is recessed from the line of the brow. The jaw intersects at the neck and forms a small triangular recessed area.\nThe figure wears a conical cap covered with a wrapping of cloth (showing three distinct sections), and over it a crown. No hair shows on the forehead. At the back of the head is a fall of hair (a ponytail-like section?) marked with diagonal grooves, except for the plain terminal section.\nThe carver has taken advantage of natural protrusions in the original amber blank for the modeling of the face. The long groove that runs from the temple to the top of the cap is plausibly a trace of fissure removal. The suspension perforation runs laterally through the top of the headdress, causing the pendant to hang slightly to its left, with the forehead tilted forward, the chin backward.\nDiscussion This head-pendant is similar to a large and varied group of female head-pendants, which includes works documented as coming from various sites in peninsular Italy and Corsica.1 82.AO.161.3 is especially close to two head-pendants from a sporadic find, a tomb group at Roscigno-Monte Pruno (Salerno, Museo Provinciale) and with two head-pendants from the Spina-Valle Lege Tomb 740B.2 They may all be of comparable date and reflect a common sculptural prototype. The Roscigno tomb is dated to the end of the fifth or beginning of the fourth century, and the terminus ante quem for the burial of the Spina head-pendants is no later than the mid-fifth century.\nNotes   Citation: La Genière 1961La Genière, J. de. “Ambre intagliate del Museo di Salerno.” Apollo 1 (1961): 73–88..

Paul Getty Museum, 1983.\nCondition The pendant is intact, but the nose is broken off. The surface is in poor condition and flaking, there are small losses over the entire piece, and it has a network of cracking. The surface is slightly glossy, suggesting an applied consolidant coating. The entire surface of the pendant is covered in a weathered yellow-ocher crust. In ambient light, the amber is yellowish brown and opaque; in transmitted light, it is dark red and clear. There are no visible inclusions.\nDescription The contortion of the form and the asymmetry of the headdress suggest that the original amber blank influenced the form of the head. The pendant represents the frontal head and small section of the neck of a female. The reverse is flat and plain, the obverse much more rounded and figured. Although the piece is worn and looks almost inorganic, the anatomy of the narrow face is modeled, including the eyeballs. The transitions from plane to plane are smooth. The brow is high and smooth, with the edge of the hair set well back. Above the eyes, the brow ridge swells slightly. The large, almond-shaped eyes meet at the root of the nose and tilt up sharply, the outer canthi higher than the inner, and both the upper and lower lid lines curve. The eyelids are unusual, flat and circumscribed by even, filletlike raised lines. The upper part of the ears are not discernible. Where the lobe of the ear would be is a small rounded area: is it the lobe or an earring? The mouth is small and curves upward. The lips are separated by a groove. The lower lip is wider than the upper one. The sulcus is curved, leading to the sharply pointed chin. The under-chin area is flat and angles backward to the jaw. The juncture of the head and neck is indicated by a groove. More of the neck vestige is visible on the left side. Framing the face at the brow are scalloplike waves, the individual strands indicated with curving parallel lines. Above the hair is a headdress that is wider than the brow, and which ends in a soft point. At its base is a slightly rounded, raised area bordered by two parallel engraved lines, which probably represent either the turnup of a felt(?) hat or the bottom of the hat and the edge of the veil. Alternatively, they may represent the edge of the veil. There is no evidence of hair at the back or sides of the head.\nA 2 mm suspension perforation extends through the top of the headdress near the top, but both holes are on the left side. This would have made the frontal head hang in profile. When suspended, the head tilts forward, with the back perpendicular to the ground.\nDiscussion This head-pendant was in the same donation group as four other female head-pendants: Citation: 83.AO.202.5Cat. no. 19 (cat. no. 19), Citation: 83.AO.202.6Cat. no. 20 (cat. no. 20), Citation: 83.AO.202.12Cat. no. 21 (cat. no. 21), and Citation: 83.AO.202.18Cat. no. 22 (cat. no. 22). All five are generally alike in size, condition, and general typology. All are asymmetrical and have off-center suspension perforations, which cause them to hang crookedly. Although they are different in style and details of dress, it is possible they come from the same original context. Figured ambers of different style, date, and type are often found in the same burial.\n83.AO.202.4 is dressed in a high conical hat covered with a veil. Citation: 83.AO.202.5Cat. no. 19 and Citation: 83.AO.202.6Cat. no. 20 are wearing a conical cap, which is set off from the straight bangs by a pair of spaced engraved lines, perhaps representing the turnup or roll-up of the cap (perhaps made from felt). The flange of amber at the back of the head of Citation: 83.AO.202.5Cat. no. 19 likely represents a wing.\nThe combination of cap, earrings, and veil of 83.AO.202.4 is the same combination worn by the figure of another Getty head-pendant ( Citation: 76.AO.85.2Cat. no. 15, cat. no. 15) and by one of the British Museum heads in-the-round (BM 45).1 The Getty head-pendant Citation: 77.AO.81.25Cat. no. 26 (cat. no. 26) is dressed in a cap (but has no veil). A much larger head-pendant in Cleveland has her hair dressed in scalloped waves at the brow like 83.AO.202.4, but like Citation: 77.AO.81.25Cat. no. 26, the Cleveland figure wears a crown in addition to the cap.2 The straight bangs topped by the cap of Citation: 83.AO.202.5Cat. no. 19 and Citation: 83.AO.202.6Cat. no. 20 is more common than the fashion of 83.AO.202.4—which is also worn by the imposing frontal head-pendants of a heavy-faced woman in London (British Museum 48, 49, 50, and 51).3 Two unprovenanced profile head-pendants in a London private collection represent a figure of the same physical type. They both wear a cap and the hair is coiffed like 83.AO.202.4. The profile, but not the garments, is comparable to the faces of a pair of legless sirens excavated from Tomb 43 at Melfi, to one of the heads from the Melfi Tomb 48 burial, and to one of the heads from Tomb 428 at Banzi.4 The profile is not far from a head-pendant in London (British Museum 52).5\nThis group of female head-pendants are characterized by their elaborate hair fashions and head-coverings—hats, veils, and crowns—and occasionally by their earrings. The dress depends on Etruscan fashion, and the style can be traced to Etruscan inventions. Despite their schematic depiction, the tiny amber pendants clearly reflect the art of the votive bronzes placed by Emeline Richardson in her Late Archaic Series, and many of them in her Group A, Ionians.6\nNotes   Citation: Strong 1966Strong, D.

Paul Getty Museum, 1983.\nCondition The pendant is in poor condition, and most detailed features are lost. The nose and the left eye are broken off. The surface is chipped and flaking, with many minute losses. The outermost brown alteration layer is flaking; the layer below is more compact and stable. Opaque and yellow-brown in ambient light, it is translucent and dark orange in transmitted illumination. There are no visible inclusions.\nDescription The pendant was carved from a lobed piece of amber. One section was used for the face, and another small spur for a section of the neck—this is located to the back of the mouth. A third lobe, at the back of the head and flangelike in shape, is plausibly a wing. It does not have any engraved lines.\n83.AO.202.5 represents the head and a section of the neck of a female. Although the piece is fragmentary, it is evident that the head was wide across the brow and tapered at the chin, much like that of Citation: 83.AO.202.4Cat. no. 18 (cat. no. 18). The eye and the bridge of the nose are broken off. The nose is clearly triangular in form, although much of it is missing. The upper lip area is short. The mouth is almost straight, but the bottom lip turns up slightly. The engraved line that separates the lips is curved upward slightly in a smile. The sulcus is short and shallow, and the chin wide and full, with a prominent chin boss. Above the brow is a fringe of bangs, the strands marked by vertical striations. Behind the bangs is a smooth, rounded-top cap. The two engraved lines separating the hair from hat depict the rim, which is either a flat turnup or a rounded roll-up.\nThe suspension perforation runs through the top of the head. When worn, the head would have been seen in profile to the left, the forehead tilted forward, casting the eyes downward.\nDiscussion From the front view, the lips, mouth, and chin resemble two heads, one from Tomb 164 and one from Tomb 428 at Banzi.1 The lower part of the face bears a familial likeness to a seated figure from Tolve.2 For further discussion, see Citation: 83.AO.202.4Cat. no. 18.\nNotes   For the ambers from Banzi, see Citation: Bottini 1987Bottini, A. “Ambre a protome umana dal Melfese.” [[BdA]] 41 (1987): 1–16..

A break, perhaps ancient, starts at the middle of the lower eyelid, and losses include the nose, mouth, and chin. There are many other large losses and chips all over the pendant. The surface is friable, with deeply cracked and pitted weathering layers. A thick yellow-ocher crust covers much of the surface. It is opaque and yellow-brown in ambient light except at the breaks, where the amber is red. In transmitted light, the pendant is translucent and red. There are no observable inclusions.\nDescription This fragmentary pendant represents a female head in profile to the left. On the obverse, the relatively flat piece of amber is figured, and on the reverse, plain. Despite the condition of the piece, many engraved lines are still visible. A large hole in the area of the jaw is likely a stopped bore. Some features remain legible. The brow is wide and smooth. Below this, a large, almond-shaped eye is set off by two engraved lines indicating lids. At the top are bangs described with vertical parallel striations. There is a rounded protrusion at the area of the ear, perhaps an ear and earring.\nThe two parallel engraved lines at the front of the hat represent the rim of the hat, either a flat turnup or a rounded roll-up.

Paul Getty Museum, 1983.\nCondition The pendant is intact but in poor condition, with a friable, flaking surface. The surface has an overall crack network. A large modern chip is on the left side of the head, and there are many other, smaller modern losses over the entire surface: these reveal the dark red-brown translucent amber beneath. In ambient light, the pendant is opaque and light yellow-tan; in transmitted light, it is dark red and translucent. There are no visible inclusions.\nDescription This head is worked from a small, flattish piece of amber. There is no indication of a neck. The reverse is uncorked and flat, and the obverse is slightly more rounded and carved. The face covers half of the pendant, while the other half is devoted to the hair and headdress. The face is widest at the eyes, narrower at the top of the head, and tapered at the chin. The brow is flat and smooth. The large, diamond-shaped eyes wrap around the head, extending from the front plane of the face to the sides of the head. The eyeballs themselves bulge slightly. Both top and bottom rims, indicated by narrow fillets, are angular at the midsection. The eyelid fillets taper in slightly at both of the canthi; they meet at the outer corners but not at the inner ones. The apex of the upper eyelids nearly meets the horizontal sections of the headdress.\nThe flat triangle-shaped nose is set off from the cheeks by a long groove that continues to the jawline, incorporating the nasolabial and mouth angle furrows. The mouth is almost straight, with a groove separating the barlike lips. The mentolabial sulcus is also grooved. The small chin projects forward to the level of the lips. Above the brow is a bandlike section of the headdress that is composed of three rounded horizontal sections separated by grooved lines. Above the horizontal sections is a tapered, plain section of the headdress that is squared off on top.\nThere is a stopped bore (1 mm in diameter) at the left side of the head that still contains its plug. A perforation extends laterally across the head at the fillet. When suspended, the head would have tilted forward, the chin back.\nDiscussion This head and Citation: 83.AO.202.18Cat. no. 22 (cat. no. 22) have many features in common with Citation: 83.AO.202.4Cat. no. 18 (cat. no. 18), Citation: 83.AO.202.5Cat. no. 19 (cat. no. 19), and Citation: 83.AO.202.6Cat. no. 20 (cat. no. 20). (For a discussion of the common features of the group, see Citation: 83.AO.202.4Cat. no. 18.) This pendant and Citation: 83.AO.202.18Cat. no. 22 depict the frontal face rather than the complete head. They are both much flatter and more schematic in conception than Citation: 83.AO.202.4Cat. no. 18 and seem to represent an older female than the other three. Most importantly, the headdress worn by 83.AO.202.12 and Citation: 83.AO.202.18Cat. no. 22 is distinctly different: it is characterized by horizontal bands on its lower edge (83.AO.202.12 has three bands, Citation: 83.AO.202.18Cat. no. 22 has four). The headdress of 83.AO.202.12 sits directly on the brow, with no head hair showing. The headdress of Citation: 83.AO.202.18Cat. no. 22 sits further back on the head, behind the straight bangs.\nThe headdress of 83.AO.202.12 and Citation: 83.AO.202.18Cat. no. 22 is a variant of the commonly represented head wraps of amber head-pendants. A striking comparison is an Etruscan votive terracotta figure in Kansas City. She wears a comparable head covering, about which Stephen Smithers noted that the three bands incised into the lower third of her cylindrical polos probably represent the winding of a cloth headdress.1 Citation: 83.AO.202.18Cat. no. 22 has straight bangs, but no hair showing in back; 83.AO.202.12 has no hair showing at all; and the Kansas City terracotta head has hair showing in front; it is parted in the middle at the brow, sweeps to each side in waves, and is short in back.\nThe almost insectlike eyes of 83.AO.202.12 and Citation: 83.AO.202.18Cat. no. 22 (and of the amber head-pendants cited as comparisons above) are similar to those of bronze korai in Emeline Richardson\u0026rsquo;s Late Archaic Series C, Group 3A (“Perugians”), such as those in Florence (Museo Archeologico Nazionale 261) and Leiden (Rijksmuseum van Oudheden C.06).2 These bronzes are sophisticated in design, mannered in details, and some have old-fashioned features. Although Richardson does not single out for mention the thickly outlined, wide-open eyes which wrap around the face, from the front to the side planes, this manner of representing the eyes must have recalled to its viewers the most ancient of hieratic female images to be found in Italy. So, too, must be the case with the amber head-pendants with huge and staring eyes.\n83.AO.202.12 and Citation: 83.AO.202.18Cat. no. 22 gain from a comparison with four other groups of amber heads. All have features stretched and skewed; all are asymmetrical; and all would have hung crookedly. All are related, even if the workmanship of 83.AO.202.12 and Citation: 83.AO.202.18Cat. no. 22 is more precise. The Getty pieces show how more was accomplished with a fine graving tool.\nWhen the Getty faces are compared to the small, late-sixth-century faces from Sabine Eretum,3 the commonalties in sculptural approach are apparent: they are all small, flat, and schematic and represent a severe, mature figure. The morphological differences between the Getty faces and those from Eretum are less marked than those between the Getty faces and a pair from a larger group of amber pendants from the above-discussed tomb at Roscigno-Monte Pruno,4 perhaps to be dated to the early fifth century. While 83.AO.202.12 and Citation: 83.AO.202.18Cat. no. 22 are closer to the Eretum and Roscigno-Monte Pruno sets, they also have features in common with two grave groups of amber head-pendants from female tombs of the first half of the fourth century. The examples are from Tombs 2 and 3 at Melfi, Cappucini.5 The three amber head-pendants of Tomb 2 were found with other figured amber pendants, a strange siren, a schematic “Achelous,” and three faces.6\nHow might this continuity be explained? These rather ugly objects demand answers to this, one of the most compelling questions concerning the working of amber in pre-Roman Italy. Certainly, the makers of the head-pendants are part of the explanation. Another part lies in the origin or prototype(s) behind the type, which must date in the earlier sixth century, if not before, in Etruria. That all of the heads were perforated to hang crookedly may be evidence of their use and identity. Is this meant to convey that they are reverted, and thus specifically refer to death, guardianship, and other magical workings?\nNotes   Citation: Smithers 1988Smithers, S.

Paul Getty Museum, 1983.\nCondition The pendant is intact but in poor condition. The surface is friable and has suffered many small chips and losses. The tip of the nose is missing. On the reverse, the amber\u0026rsquo;s surface-layer flaking is particularly severe. A yellow-ocher crust covers most of the surface. Areas with crust losses reveal a more compact and less altered amber beneath, and under transmitted light, additional subsurface cracking is visible. The pendant is opaque and yellow-brown in color in ambient light. Under transmitted illumination, it is translucent and dark red-brown. There are no visible inclusions.\nDescription The original amber nodule seems to have determined the form of the pendant. The obverse is more convex, the highest point at the bridge of the nose. The reverse is plain and flat. The asymmetrical, triangle-shaped face tapers from a wide brow to a small, pointed chin. The hair and headdress are wide at the base but narrow at the chin. The holes for suspension are located in the top of the headdress on obverse and reverse. When hung, the head exposes its right profile. The brow is flat above the enormous bulbous eyes. Each eyelid is rendered with two filletlike rims that are the same width both above and below the eyes. They meet at both inner and outer canthi. The eyeballs are on the same plane as the eyelids and bulge as in nature. The glabella is wide. Despite the losses to the nose, its form can be discerned as being short and narrow. The upper lip area is also short and the mouth is small. The lips are rendered as two bars, the upper one set off from the nose by a short groove. Two short vertical grooves, which run from the wings of the nose to the chin line, demarcate the mouth-angle furrow. A slight ridge sets off the thick bangs from the brow. The bangs of the hair continue from the obverse onto the narrow sides; the pattern of the hair is indicated by fine diagonal grooves fanning out from the center. There are neither ears nor neck indicated on this figure. Atop the head is a headdress separated from the hair by a slight ridge. This headdress is made up of four rounded horizontal fillets.\nDiscussion This pendant has many features in common with Citation: 83.AO.202.4Cat. no. 18 (cat. no. 18), Citation: 83.AO.202.5Cat. no. 19 (cat. no. 19), Citation: 83.AO.202.6Cat. no. 20 (cat. no. 20), and Citation: 83.AO.202.12Cat. no. 21 (cat. no. 21).

Paul Getty Museum, 1977.\nCondition The surface is stable, firm, and clean, but it is worn, especially on the front of the face. There is a large fracture loss on the reverse at the top; large losses behind the left ear, above the right ear, and at the top front of the head around the cracked suspension hole; and small chips under the right eye and below the jaw. Fissures run downward along the right side of the nose to the chin as well as along the right temple. There are cracks on the face, beneath the chin on the left side, on the temple, and running from the crown to the right ear. There are traces of yellowish degradation residue in the cracks and grooves. The surface is slightly glossy, suggesting an applied consolidant coating. The amber is translucent and dark red-brown in ambient light. Under transmitted light, the pendant is transparent and red. In the large fissure extending from the top, near the eye, to the chin is an inclusion.\nDescription 77.AO.81.5 represents the head and neck of a female figure. On the back of the head is a wing. The pendant is carved fully in the round. The eyes are large and lozenge-shaped, with the proximal corners of the eyes nearly joined over the nose. They curve around from the front to the side planes. The lids are indicated by parallel grooves, roughly carved and relatively angular. What remains of the nose suggests that it was a flattish triangular bar. The mouth is small and turned up slightly, as if in a smile. The lips are rendered as curved bars. The nasolabial furrow continues to the jawline, giving the face a jowly look. The ears are small, flat semicircular nubs. They are located high on the head and overlap the edge of the headdress. The chin is small and the under-chin area fleshy. The neck is set off from the face and from the hair by two deep grooves.\nThe figure wears a conical hat with a high rounded crown. It is cloth-wrapped. None of her hair is showing in the front. However, at the back of the neck, a section carved with finely spaced engraved lines must represent a long tress. The secondary feathers of the wing on the back of the head are indicated with upward directional engraved lines.\nThe shape of the pendant suggests that the original form of the amber was teardrop-shaped. The long smoothed grooves are the result of a precarving cleaning of surface fissures or inclusions. The vestigial neck of the figure is formed from a spur of amber. A 2 mm perforation for suspension passes laterally through the top of the headdress. When suspended, the chin was recessed close to the neck, making the eyes look downward.\nDiscussion The smoothing on the prominent surfaces—nose, eyes, mouth, and chin—is evidence of considerable preburial use wear. For the figure\u0026rsquo;s dress, see entry for Citation: 77.AO.81.25Cat. no. 26 (cat. no. 26); for a discussion of wings on amber head-pendants, see entry for Citation: 76.AO.85.2Cat. no. 15 (cat. no. 15). In frontal view, this head has an uncanny similarity to a unique and odd Etruscan votive bronze of a togate male figure in Naples, who wears a close-fitting hat or net incised with a scale pattern. (Or is this the hair?) Hans Jucker places this togate figure in his Populonia group; Emeline Richardson places it in her Late Archaic grouping, Type 2A, “Ionians.”1 Although there is no close parallel for 77.AO.81.5, it corresponds in dress and type to three other amber head-pendants. One was found with thirteen other head-pendants in a “princely” tomb at Roscigno-Monte Pruno, the context dated to the early fifth century.2 The second is a head-pendant from Tomb 106 at Banzi, from a context dated to the first quarter of the fifth century.3 The third is a much-worn head-pendant in the Getty, Citation: 77.AO.81.25Cat. no. 26. The schematic carving of the eyes, nose, and mouth is comparable to one of the heads from Tomb 428 at Banzi.4\nNotes   Naples, Museo Archeologico Nazionale 5534, found on Elba: H.

Paul Getty Museum, 1982.\nCondition The pendant\u0026rsquo;s top proper right quarter was broken and reglued in modern times from three fragments. On the obverse are a number of both old and modern small chips: at the perforation, on the left and right sides of the face, and at the top and right sides of the head. On the reverse is a fissure. The lack of detail on the prominent surfaces of the face strongly suggests use wear. There is a scattered, spotty, yellow-ocher degradation overall, with some associated surface pitting. The amber is friable in the vicinity of breaks. The amber is opaque and yellow-orange in ambient light. Under transmitted light, it is translucent and dull red. With the exception of the material in the fissure, there are no visible inclusions.\nDescription This frontal face of a female figure is concave on the obverse and flat on the reverse. The figure is wearing a high soft hat and a veil and has straight bangs. The visible section of the brow is short and broad. There are no indications of ears. The widely spaced large eyes are flat and almond-shaped and are bounded by rims composed of thick fillets. The nose is broad and snubbed. All that remains of the mouth are two grooves. Nevertheless, it is clear that the upper lip hung over the lower one. The jaw is squarish and the chin pointed. Above the brow are straight bangs with vestiges of vertical striations. The softly rounded high hat has a turnup indicated by two parallel engraved lines. A veil covers the hat and ears but not the bangs.\nBecause of the eroded surface of this piece, no tool marks are visible. A suspension perforation was drilled laterally through the top of the piece. When suspended, the back is perpendicular to the ground. The head tilts forward, the chin is close to the neck, and the eyes appear downcast.\nDiscussion 82.AO.161.7 wears a costume similar to that of many other amber head-pendants; however, her hat is rather more rounded on top than most. In form and its manner of hanging, the frontal face is akin to a face from a tomb at Kompolje, Croatia.1 In style, it is similar to the three well-preserved heads from the tomb. The profile relates it to a head-pendant from Tomb 2 at Tolve.2\nNotes   For the ambers from the Kompolje tomb, see R.

Paul Getty Museum, 1977.\nCondition The surface of the amber is smooth and solid, but shows an uneven pattern of abrasion and loss of detail on the most prominent areas, suggesting use wear. Before purchase by the donor, the pendant\u0026rsquo;s surface was treated with a surface consolidant. There are several ancient breaks (they have the same degraded surface as the unbroken areas), including the bridge of the nose and a section on the back on the reverse. There are small chips on the cheek. A more recent break at the back was reglued before the object\u0026rsquo;s arrival at the Getty Museum. On the reverse are three large depressions, possibly from the removal of flaws or fissures by the carver or weathering losses. In ambient light, the piece is translucent and dark reddish brown; in transmitted light, it is red and fully translucent. There are no visible inclusions.\nDescription The pendant is composed of the head and section of the neck of a female head, carved from a relatively flat piece of amber. The figuration is on the obverse and the two sides. The back is plain, but uneven because of the shape of the original amber piece. The shallow crevices are the result of preburial preparation of the amber nodule, by the removal of fissures or inclusions.\nThe figure\u0026rsquo;s brow is smooth and on the same plane as the mouth and nose. There is a groove above the large almond-shaped eye, and the eye\u0026rsquo;s outside corner is higher than the inner corner. The lids curve smoothly, taper slightly at the corners, and are outlined with a raised fillet. The nose is set off from the cheeks and upper lip area by grooves. The area above the upper lip is short. The lips are large bar-shaped forms that curve from the obverse to the front edge. They are separated from each other by a groove. The mentolabial sulcus is a deeper groove. The receding chin is rounded and the under-chin area full. The triangular section of neck is described by two grooves. The area of the ear is indistinct, not only because the surface is much worn but also because there is a natural concavity there. However, a slight swelling at the bottom of the bangs may indicate the ear.\nAbove the brow is a fringe of bangs, the strands of which are indicated by eight short diagonal incisions. Behind these is a cap set off from the hair by a raised filletlike form, which probably represents the rim of the cap. The cap is a squared conical shape. At the back of the head is a curved chignonlike section of hair extending to the nape of the neck. It is engraved with three lines perpendicular to those in the bangs.\nThe pendant was hung from a V-shaped pair of holes. The piece was drilled from two sides through the top of the cap. The front hole is 3.5 mm wide, and the rear hole is 4 mm. The pendant would have hung with the chin recessed, the brow forward.\nDiscussion 77.AO.81.30 is generally similar in style and dress to Citation: 77.AO.81.25Cat. no. 26 (cat. no. 26). It is closer, however, especially in the overall format and in the hairstyle, to two well-preserved pendants from Tomb 164 at Banzi.1 The styling of the hair at the back of the heads is remarkably similar in all three works: it is short, curled under, with the lower edge forming a soft curve. The horizontal waves are rendered by fine engraved lines. However, there are differences in the hair treatment. 77.AO.81.30 has straight bangs. One of the Banzi head-pendants has horizontal waves at the brow and the other scallops. Both Tomb 164 figures have a raised fillet at the neck edge, perhaps a necklace, perhaps a mark evoking the form of the decorative protome—as is characteristic of amber horses\u0026rsquo;-head pendants. 77.AO.81.30 does not have such a fillet.\nAngelo Bottini compared the Banzi amber head-pendants to coin types of Syracuse and Athens of the late sixth and early fifth century and dated Tomb 164 “to the first quarter of the fifth century, at the latest.”2 Bottini made a strong case for a local manufacture of the Tomb 164 head-pendants but at the same time argued for a more careful consideration of the territory and its cultural relations with the larger world.\nThe Banzi Tomb 164 head-pendants and 77.AO.81.30 correspond in general type to Emeline Richardson\u0026rsquo;s series of Late Archaic bronze korai.3 A comparison with her Group 5D, especially with the group\u0026rsquo;s name piece, Naples, Museo Archeologico Nazionale 5532 (provenance unknown), brings out their common features. They look to be of the same physiognomic type and are dressed in a similar manner. As Richardson establishes, Naples 5532 is an old-fashioned work, one that looks back to earlier conceptions of the kore type in Etruria, especially to the Ionian series of the late sixth and early fifth century.\nNotes   Melfi, Museo Archeologico Nazionale del Melfese 51436: Citation: Bottini 1990Bottini, A. “Le ambre intagliate a figura umana del Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Melfi.” Archeologia: WrocŁaw Zakład Narodowy im.

Paul Getty Museum, 1977.\nCondition The pendant was joined from two pieces along a slight oblique plane at the level of the eyes. Chips are missing at the breaks, on the eyes, at the area of the hair on the left side, behind the left ear, at the corner of the left jaw, along the right side of the neck, and in the region of the left eye. There is a large fissure along the left side of the head below the perforation. Another fissure crosses laterally immediately above the suspension perforation. The surface of the piece is crazed overall and subsurface cracking is visible in transmitted light. There is a pocket of flaky yellowish residue under the right side of the chin. A cloudy inclusion at the center of the piece is visible at the break. In ambient light, the pendant is opaque and dark reddish brown in color; in transmitted light, it is translucent and a lighter red-brown.\nDescription The ovoid head-pendant is composed of the head and a portion of the neck of a female figure. The pendant seems to follow the convolutions of the natural lump of amber from which it was worked: the face, neck, and headdress are on the more rounded obverse, while the flatter reverse is smoothed but not figured. A groove on the back and a crater above the ear may be evidence of the removal of inclusions. The suspension perforation is located in the head: there is a lateral bore 3.5 mm in diameter. It passes laterally behind the crown on each side of the head. Both exits are abraded on the upper inside edges, no doubt from friction from the carrier. This and the wear on the prominent surfaces are evidence of ancient wear.\nDespite the shallow carving and wear to the object, its features are still legible. The face is full and rounded. The eyes are large and almond-shaped, with thick and cordlike eyebrows. The outside corners of the eyes are upturned slightly, the left more than the right. The brow ridges rise slightly above the eyes. There is only a slight indentation for the root of the nose, which is now flat. Grooves running from the inner canthi of the eyes to the corner of the lips on each side incorporate the sides of the nose and the nasolabial furrows. The lips are almost straight, semicylindrical bars. The mouth-angle furrows are indicated by shallow grooves, the mentolabial sulcus by an indentation. The chin is full, and the jawline rounded. The figure has large ears and wears round earrings. The neck is cylindrical with a distinct fullness.\nAbove the smooth brow are bangs that divide in the middle of the forehead and are brushed diagonally to each side; the strands of hair are individuated by diagonal grooves. The figure wears a conical hat, a veil, and a crown. The veil covers only the hair, cap, and ears. The veil has straight pleated folds indicated by modeling on the back of the head. The tiaralike crown is decorated with a grooved border at all of the edges. The lower edge of the crown is set off from the bangs by an engraved line. The crown\u0026rsquo;s upper edge stands above the head. The sides of the crown stop just above and in front of the ears.\nDiscussion There is a parallel for this head-pendant in Munich, one also modeled fully in the round.1 The Munich amber is drilled with a lateral suspension hole in the top of the head in the same position as that of 77.AO.81.25. In addition, the Munich head has a metal loop (date uncertain) inserted in the top of the head. The two figures differ in dress: although the Munich head has bangs, a cap, and a veil, it does not have a crown or earrings.\nVariants of this head-pendant\u0026rsquo;s elements of adornment—hat, crown, earrings, veil, and styled hair—are characteristic of many other head-pendants worn by Etruscan Archaic bronze korai, the earliest of which are in Emeline Richardson\u0026rsquo;s Middle Archaic series.2 The best Etruscan bronze parallels for the amber are found in Richardson\u0026rsquo;s groupings of Late Archaic korai, especially the Late Archaic Series A, Ionian,3 and a related group of bronzes, Group 5D, Naples, Museo Archeologico Nazionale 5532.4 Two bronzes from Series A, one in Vienna (Kunsthistorisches Museum 71) and one in Copenhagen (Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek H224), are a set of important comparanda for 77.AO.81.25.5 The Getty amber head-pendant and the two Series A bronzes are all recognizably Ionian in style, as the name given to the bronzes by Richardson underlines. Richardson placed Vienna 71 and Copenhagen H224 into different subgroups of Series A: Vienna 71 in her Group 2, Tomba del Barone, and Copenhagen H224 in her Group 6, Late Korai. The physiognomy of 77.AO.81.25 is most like that of Copenhagen H224 (which is bareheaded), but the dress is more like that of Vienna 71—who, too, is capped, crowned, earringed, and veiled.\nA comparison to Naples 5532 brings out additional Ionian and Etruscan aspects of 77.AO.81.25. This bronze kore represents a physical type very much like 77.AO.81.25; they both have the same “big head and long face.”6 The votive also provides a model for how 77.AO.81.25 would look if the amber were a complete figure. Richardson describes the draping of Naples 5532\u0026rsquo;s veil as “pulled over the cap so that two ends fall on the shoulders [with] the rest [hanging] in a long panel down the back.”7 This is the same South Ionian fashion of veil worn by the Getty amber Kore, Citation: 76.AO.77Cat. no. 8 (cat. no. 8).\nNotes   Munich, Antikensammlungen 15.003. ↩ Citation: Richardson 1983Richardson, E.

Paul Getty Museum, 1982.\nCondition The piece has a severely degraded and friable surface. A large fragment on the lower edge of the animal\u0026rsquo;s head has been reattached. The surface has altered to an opaque light-tan degradation layer that is flaked and chipped overall, and there is a corresponding loss of surface detail. In ambient light, the pendant is yellow-orange. It is not translucent, and there are no visible inclusions.\nDescription The disk-shaped amber is carved in high relief on the obverse and is plain and completely flat on the reverse. The sides are tapered inward slightly from the bottom. The animal\u0026rsquo;s head is depicted in top view, with the chin, throat, and neck ventrally flush with the base. The left flank of the body is presented in profile view, with only one each of the fore- and hindlegs shown. The large head is paddle-shaped, rather flat on top, and wide through the ear area. The lower jaw is narrow and flat, the mouth an engraved line that extends as far as the outer canthus of the eye. The neck is thin. The bulges and indentations on each side of the head at the point of its greatest width must represent the ears. There is no legible evidence of eyes. The long tongue is extended, touching the rear hoof. Flush with the curve of the pendant\u0026rsquo;s edge, the animal\u0026rsquo;s back is rounded with a slight indentation just above and before the curve of the haunch, and just behind it is the tiniest indication of a tail. The chest and abdomen areas are approximately the same size as the head. The front leg is long and thin from knee to hoof and is bent at the ankle, as in nature. The powerful back leg and haunch curve forward. The nonfigured area in the middle of the roundel is recessed below the animal. There are two sets of holes: a perforation between the rear hoof and the tongue, and a lateral perforation from one side of the animal\u0026rsquo;s neck to the other. Along the dorsal ridge, equally spaced from the neck to the ankle, are six 3.5 mm-deep, tapered stopped bores.\nDiscussion Unique in form and subject, the roundel is unlike any other amber object. The round, thin form, with its flat reverse, beveled edge, perforation, and stopped bores, suggests that 82.AO.161.2 was originally the lid of a small, round pyxis. If that is the case, the perforations, the through-bore in the neck area, and the hole between the foot and the tongue may have been used for attaching a lid to a container. Alternatively, the lateral bore through the top of the animal may have been drilled to allow for hanging, perhaps as an ornament. This may have been a secondary use.1\nOne of the best parallels for the roundel is not an amber object but an ivory lid from the Idaean cave, Crete, published as North Syrian by J. A. Sakellerakis.2 This beveled-edge lid is decorated with an overall geometric pattern and has a similar system of stopped bores, or mortises, on its edge. 82.AO.161.2 might also be compared to a group of Roman-period amber pyxis (or perfume pot?) lids, three of them in the British Museum: a nonfigured lid (BM 115), turned with a series of convex and concave moldings, engraved lines, and narrow fillets (very close in size to 82.AO.161.2,3 and two slightly larger figured lids, one of a sleeping swan with putti on his back (BM 117), and the other, a satyr face (BM 118)).4\nThe placing of an animal, resting or in movement, within a circular format is age-old. A contorted animal within a tondo is a distinct subset of the schema.5 As John Boardman notes, compositions with contorted animals, whose form is characterized by the dislocation of the legs or another portion of the body, imply movement and allow the circular field to be filled more symmetrically.6 Even though the contortion in 82.AO.161.2 only extends to the twisting of the animal\u0026rsquo;s head into top view and the body and legs into profile, the composition still calls to mind the whirling compositions of Cretan seal stones, which\n express the old Minoan feeling for torsion and for spreading designs which own no top or bottom or sides. But these contorted animals are not simple essays in the grotesque as they are often described, but the artist\u0026rsquo;s rendering of a novel but natural viewpoint, top three-quarter of a reclining animal with his legs before him, the hindquarters twisted to one side. 7\n A group of stone seals from the Greek islands, dating to the second half of the seventh century B.C., appear to be the only comparable post–Bronze Age Mediterranean objects decorated with the “old Minoan” type of contorted animals. Boardman considers a group from Melos to be dependent on actual Bronze Age seals found on the island, noting they “are of an importance and interest far beyond their intrinsic merit, because they show us how artists could be influenced by the arts and artifacts of a past civilization, otherwise remembered only by the poets.”8\nIt may be that 82.AO.161.2 is a comparable seventh-century response—although there is no Bronze Age object with a comparable representation of a quadruped. The tongue extension, too, is unusual. Does the animal lick its hind leg, or is the tongue extended in exertion?9\nThe condition of the amber and the schematic depiction of the animal do not allow for a sure classification of the quadruped. However, the salient physiognomic characteristics, and the position of the tongue, lead me to think that it is a fawn. This identity is posited despite the lack of a close comparison and despite some resemblance to a number of seventh-century ivory and amber dogs.10 However, the feet of 82.AO.161.2 are entirely different from the wide, multitoed feet of these dogs: they are tiny and undifferentiated.\nAn isolated fawn is an infrequent subject in ancient art, uncommon as the subject of a pendant, and exceptional in amber.11 The morphological characteristics of the animal depicted in 82.AO.161.2 compare well with those of a number of Greek Late Geometric fawns, does, or groups of a doe and her suckling fawn. Two bronze statuettes and a pair of bronze amphora handles assure the identity of the amber animal. The bronze of a standing fawn on a rectangular base in the Harvard collections has a similarly paddle-shaped head and nubs of ears set far back on the head.12 A standing fawn in the Menil Collection, Houston, which has a shorter, blunter head and huge ears and a dappled coat suggested by tiny concentric marks, is another schematic representation.13 More naturalistic are the early-fifth-century pairs of fawns (deer?) of two nearly identical Etruscan (Vulcian?) bronze amphora handles, one in Boston and the other in a private collection.14 On each handle, at the base, squats a syrinx-playing satyr. The connection of a satyr playing panpipes and sleeping fawns may be relevant for the amber roundel.\nThe subject of an animated fawn in amber, especially if it were an ornament, calls to mind the most famous brooch of ancient literature, a daidalon, the cunningly fashioned gold pin worn by the disguised Odysseus:\n Godlike Odysseus wore a purple cloak of wool, double thick; but on it was fashioned a pin of gold with double clasps, with a daidalon in front: a hound was holding in its forepaws a dappled fawn, preying on it while it struggled. All were marveling at it how though they were [of] gold, the one preyed on the fawn throttling it, but the other struggled with its feet as it tried to flee. (Odyssey 19.225–31)\n Because 82.AO.161.2 may have been an ornament, a rare image of a figure wearing a fawn pendant should be recalled: this is the fawn\u0026rsquo;s head worn by the bronze youth in the Guglielmi Collection of the Vatican.15\nThe only other amber fawn known to me is in the center of a large pendant in London (British Museum 35), a representation of Bacchic revelers.16 From between the two dancers, leaps up a fawn, a scene from the Dionysian thiasos.17 The fawns and satyr of the Etruscan bronze amphora handles link the vessel, wine, and Dionysos. The fawn of 82.AO.161.2 may have been intended to refer to a nature divinity other than Dionysos. In the Geometric period in Greece, deer (and fawns) are associated with the Olympians Hera, Athena, and Apollo. In Archaic and Classical Greece, deer and fawns are most commonly associated with the children of Leto, although they are important in depictions of Dionysos and Herakles and hunting generally. There appears to have been a special association of deer with weddings and cultic activity in Attica.18 Fawns are held in the arms of many Archaic terracotta images of Artemis or her votaries, and images of fawns are found in sanctuaries of Artemis.19\nNot only did young girls imitate she-bears for Artemis at the Attic site of Brauron, in Thessaly, girls performed a ritual in which they played the part of fawns. Both rituals were considered preparatory for pregnancy and childbirth.20 By the end of the sixth century B.C., the fawn is pictured on Attic vases as a love gift between older and younger men, a custom that introduces Aphrodite into the picture.21\nWhether lid or pendant, dog or deer, the ultimate use of 82.AO.161.2 was funerary. The animated creature embodied in the amber tondo, eternally circling in a whirling composition, a design without beginning or end, might signify the cycle of life. Here, the idea of regeneration would be perfectly synthesized in material, subject, and form.\nNotes   Theoretically, a filament strung through the through-bore in the neck area would cause the pendant to hang perpendicular to the ground, with the animal head downward. When suspended from both perforations, the animal would have hung with head upward, as if trussed for carrying. ↩ J. A. Sakellerakis, “The Idean Cave Ivories,” in Citation: Fitton 1992Fitton, J.

The running dog may specifically refer to the hunt. If the animal is licking its hind foot, this action may have been considered a medico-magical technique, as it was in Mesopotamia and Egypt. As Citation: Ritner 1993Ritner, R. K. The Mechanics of Ancient Egyptian Magical Practice. Chicago, 1993., p. 933, notes, “The magical transfer of health or blessing by saliva reflects such naturally observable phenomena as the licking of wounds. As a magical technique, licking represents a ritualized extension of such instinctive acts.” Licking could be equated with a solar blessing and solar “licking” with the rays of the early dawn, as Citation: Ritner 1993Ritner, R. K. The Mechanics of Ancient Egyptian Magical Practice. Chicago, 1993., p. 94, points out. For licking imagery in Mesopotamian magic, Ritner refers to J. and A. Westenholz, “Help for Rejected Suitors: The Old Akkadian Love Incantation MAD V 8,” Orientalia 46 (1977): 215 (“Then the ewe licked [literally ‘took good care of’] her lamb”). The composition might also be compared to the motif of a trussed ibex licking its hind foot on Egyptian toilet articles in the shape of ibexes. ↩ These include the single dog from Tomb VI at Satricum (see Citation: Waarsenburg 1995Waarsenburg, D. J. The Northwest Necropolis of Satricum: An Iron Age Cemetery in Latium Vetus. Amsterdam, 1995., passim and pp. 452–53), and three from Narce (a pair from the Monte Cerreto necropolis, Tomb 103, and a singleton from the Pizzo Piede necropolis; for references, see Citation: Negroni Catacchio 1999Negroni Catacchio, N. “Alcune ambre figurate preromane di provenienza italiana in collezioni private di New York.” In Kiona: Miscellanea di studi archeologici in onore di Piero Orlandini, ed. C. Castoldi, pp. 279–90. Milan, 1999., p. 283, n. 16. Three other unpublished dogs that also have collars are Louvre Bj 2124–2126. Bj 2124 has large circular inlays; Bj 2125 is plain; and Bj 2126 is complete and retains fragments of a gold collar. These dogs are all close in style and conception and are very like the ivory dogs from Cameiros, also noted by Citation: Waarsenburg 1995Waarsenburg, D. J. The Northwest Necropolis of Satricum: An Iron Age Cemetery in Latium Vetus. Amsterdam, 1995., p. 452 (citing D. G. Hogarth, Excavations at Ephesus: The Archaic Artemisia of Ephesus (London, 1908), pl. 30. The Italian amber dogs are from the same family as the confronted pairs embellishing identical ivory roundels from the Tomb of the Ivories at Marsiliana d\u0026rsquo;Albegna in Grosseto; see M. Benzi, “Gli avori della Marsiliana d\u0026rsquo;Albegna,” Atti dell\u0026rsquo;Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, Rendiconti 21 (1966): 253–92. The importance of the dog in early Etruria is indicated by the trios of dogs on the ritual tripod-basins from the Barberini and Bernardini (Praeneste) tombs. However, if 82.AO.161.2 does represent a dog, the iconography would match well with the roundel\u0026rsquo;s material, since the dog is associated with female goddesses, including Hekate, Artemis, and Eileithyia; see Citation: Waarsenburg 1995Waarsenburg, D. J. The Northwest Necropolis of Satricum: An Iron Age Cemetery in Latium Vetus. Amsterdam, 1995., pp. 452–53 nn. 1268–73. Waarsenburg underlines the importance of the dog in Italy, indicating key comparanda in art, and shows that it “played a key role in religious and magical-superstitious beliefs. Popular beliefs connected the dog with ghosts, death, fertility, and childbirth.… As was expressly declared by Pliny NH.39.58, and evidenced by the nature of the mentioned rites, the dog\u0026rsquo;s sacral association was very old … and the meaning of the rites related to dogs was not understood anymore, not even by the priest performing them.” The origin of the amber dog must lie not in Egypt but in the ancient Near East. The early Italian amber and ivory dogs are probably associated with healing and specific goddesses. As Citation: Black and Green 1992Black, J., and A. Green. Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia: An Illustrated Dictionary. Austin, TX, 1992., p. 71, summarize: “The sitting dog first occurs as a divine symbol in the Old Babylonian Period and continues through to the Neo-Babylonian. Inscriptions on kudurrus identify it as the symbol of Gula, goddess of healing.… King Nebuchadnezzar II records the placing of statuettes of gold, silver and bronze dogs as deposits in the gates of Gula\u0026rsquo;s temple at Babylon.… In the Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian Periods, the dog, sitting and standing, was also used as a magically protective figure, not attached to any individual deity.” On dogs as large-scale talismans in the ancient world, see Citation: Faraone 1992Faraone, C.

Roman amber objects—rings, perfume containers, boxes, small figures, or small figural groups—are often carved with Dionysian subjects. All of these survived because they were ultimately grave furnishings. On Roman amber pyxides (or perfume pots?), Dionysian themes are the most common of subjects. There are many reasons for the tie between amber and Dionysos, among them amber\u0026rsquo;s age-old association with fecundity, regeneration, and healing, its role in averting danger, its chthonic importance, and its winelike optical properties. An Etruscan stone sarcophagus lid of an older woman who is joined by a fawn suggests the presence of Dionysos. ↩ See S.

Paul Getty Museum, 1978.\nCondition The plaque is intact except for two losses: a large chip on the reverse, at the bottom of the right-hand perforation, and in a portion of the obverse wall of the left-hand perforation, just below the jaw. The surface of the flat bottom is much less degraded than that of the rest of the object, which is in poor condition, with a uniformly degraded top layer that is granular and friable. Dirt and white-gray encrustations adhere to the surface on all sides, especially inside the top of the left-side bore. There are also losses on the reverse at the top and in the right-side bore exit. No inclusions are visible. Where the surface is intact, the amber\u0026rsquo;s color varies from sandy yellow to gray-brown; in the numerous areas where the internal material is exposed, it is rich brown. Held against the light, the amber is orange.\nDescription Addorsed sphinxes, in repose and reguardant, decorate the rectilinear plaque, which is carved in the round. The thin slab of amber is modeled in low, flat relief on the obverse, reverse, and sides; it is smoothed almost flat on the bottom.\nDespite the poor condition of the pendant, the salient features of the two sphinxes are still decipherable. Engraved lines in the lower central part of the composition are the remains of divisions between the vanes of the primary feathers. On the top side, the hatted heads (the hats may be flat petasoi) and the details of the wing tips are clearly visible. On the lateral sides, indistinct details of the heads and the indentation for the neck, the breast, and the legs remain. On the reverse, the back of the hair, the contours of the upper section of the wings, the lower bodies, and the legs are still visible. The hair is fashioned in a shoulder-length cut, the Etagenperüke, or stepped wig, and it is visible on the obverse, the short sides, and on the reverse. The large frontal faces are in higher relief than the bodies. The heads are wide and flat at the top and are large in proportion to the bodies and wings: each head measures over one-quarter of the width and over half the height of the composition.\nThe sphinxes have broad, flat brows, the suggestion of long prominent noses, high and wide cheeks, wide jaws, narrow but prominent chins, and small mouths. The distance from the parting of the lips to the apex of the chin is short. The better preserved of the heads (at right) is carved with bulbous, slanted eyes, the outer canthi just slightly higher than the inner ones.\nLittle can be determined about the manufacture due to the poor state of conservation. The plaque appears to reflect the shape of the original piece of amber, for the level of relief varies over the obverse and reverse, and the sides. The obverse has a greater depth of relief than the other sides. The upper contours are asymmetrical and the bottom is uneven.\nTwo large tapered perforations located 7 mm from either end were bored on the same vertical line as the medial line of the creatures\u0026rsquo; heads. At the top, the holes are 4.5 mm in diameter and at the bottom 6 mm. The fragment of a bronze(?) tube, constructed from a roll of thin sheeting (0.3 mm thick), remains in the one perforation and the residue of a metallic corrosion product is found in the other. This strongly suggests that both holes were similarly lined. In the depression between the wings at the top is a stopped bore, 5 mm deep and 3 mm in diameter (for an addition?).\nDiscussion This amber plaque has no parallel in subject or form. The sphinxes, while related to various Greek and Etruscan types, have no close analogues. When new, the natural translucency and color of the amber would have been augmented by the internal reflections of the metallic sheaths lining the perforations. The two vertical perforations must each have carried filaments, and because of this it does not seem likely that a suspension device was inserted into the stopped bore on the top edge. An additional decorative element (of amber or another material) was almost certainly placed there instead. The direction of the through-bores and the figural design imply that the plaque functioned in a horizontal position, perhaps as part of a larger object, hanging from a pin, head ornament, or necklace (in front, or in back as a counterweight).\nThe metal-lined perforations are not found on any other figured amber objects but are common on many fibulae and on many other kinds of amber objects. The technique is an old one and is known in eighth-century Greece, with examples from Lefkandi, Tekke, and Salamis.1 Seventh-century examples are the fibulae and other kinds of amber objects from the opulent burials of Verucchio and Cumae.2 The metal linings not only offered protection from abrasion and breakage, they also added to the brilliance of the amber, exploiting its natural clarity, brilliance, and luminosity.\nThe sphinxes of the plaque exhibit many conventions of seventh-century representations: large triangular faces projecting from small squat bodies, a stepped hairstyle, and low, flat hat. The style of 78.AO.286.2 is a complex blend, one that shows connections to earlier North Syrian objects,3 and to even earlier Mycenaean ivory-carving traditions. The latter is demonstrated by comparison with early sphinx-subject ivories from Mycenae and Athens.4 The low relief carving and squared-up sphinxes of 78.AO.286.2 are similar to a number of small seventh-century ivories from Greece and Italy, from Ephesus, Sparta, and Perachora, and from Comeana.5 However, perhaps the best analogues are the relief metope-sphinxes of certain Cretan amphorae and terracotta pinakes of the seventh century.6 There is also an unmistakable relationship between 78.AO.286.2 and some Archaic Campanian sphinxes of later date, to the bicorporal sphinxes of terracotta, horseshoe-shaped plaques from Capua (of circa 575–550 B.C.; a notable example is in Copenhagen)7 and to three small bronze sphinxes (one in Boston and two in Baltimore, possibly from the same bowl), thought to come from Cumae.8 These similarities may be taken as evidence that the maker and or model of 78.AO.286.2 had a lasting influence in Campania. A seventh-century date for 78.AO.286.2 can be extrapolated from the other amber objects said to have been found with it, including the Hippocamp, Citation: 78.AO.286.1Cat. no. 29 (cat. no. 29).9\nA double sphinx is a nonnarrative subject, unlike the single sphinx, the devourer, which might call up the story of Oedipus. The double sphinxes may have held special force, since they look backward and forward, left and right, perhaps doubling the power of a single sphinx. The motif of a double sphinx had a venerable history as a potent subject in the circum-Mediterranean area. Generally, repetition is an age-old formula for increasing the potency of any amulet, spell, or curse.10\nGenerally related in form to 78.AO.286.2 are the Egyptian amulets in the form of addorsed lions and of back-to-back foreparts of bulls and rams, the latter having a full moon with a crescent nestling between their backs.11 Contemporary with 78.AO.286.2 is one variant of the Egyptian addorsed lions amulet type. The suspension loop was placed between the animals\u0026rsquo; backs in such a way that it resembles a sun disk, suggesting an underlying connection with Rwty, “over whose back the sun rose each day.”12 Might the stopped bore on the top of 78.AO.286.2 have once supported an added image (perhaps a device in the form of) a solar disk or other symbolic element?\nThere is no evidence for the preburial function of the amber (the condition prevents any conjecture about signs of wear). If it were worn in life, 78.AO.286.2 may have functioned in a way parallel to that of the Egyptian addorsed animal and sphinx amulets. The amber may have brought to the wearer the underlying savagery of the lion, as the sphinx subject did in Egypt. (Since at least the Middle Kingdom, the single-sphinx amulet had been understood to link the wearer with the pharaoh\u0026rsquo;s protective power and authority and the lion\u0026rsquo;s power.) The doubled sphinxes could have invited the protective and propitious powers of the composite creature. Double sphinxes of amber might double the curse of “fighting fire with fire.” Certainly, the inherent potency of the amber was magnified and focused, and the object more efficacious, when carved with such a time-honored potent subject. In the grave, 78.AO.286.2 would have played a powerful guardian role: the sphinx who escorts the dead, the watchdog who punishes those who disturb the dead, could also protect the “house” of the grave.13\nNotes   For the technique and its eighth-century history in Greece, see introduction, n. 48 and n. 50. ↩ For the Verucchio material, see Citation: Verucchio 1994Il dono delle Eliadi: Ambre e oreficerie dei principi etruschi di Verucchio.

Paul Getty Museum, 1978.\nCondition Although the surface of the pendant is in poor condition (with an extensive loss of surface detail), it is intact minus a triangular break in the mane. There is extensive flaking on the surface. A surface coating may have been applied before it entered the Getty Museum. This piece is opaque, but part of its surface retains some of the original integument, which is tan-brown; the rest of the surface is darker reddish brown. Illuminated with transmitted light, the amber is translucent and orange-red. Several areas have small inclusions.\nDescription The pendant, carved fully in the round, represents a dormant hippocamp. The head is resting on the coiled body and tail. On the obverse is the head, neck, the right lower leg, and, by implication, the upper body of the sea horse and a section of its tail, which loops in a counterclockwise fashion. On the reverse are the left front leg and the tail end of the coils, which curl in a clockwise direction. The ruffled edge on the tail must be a section of the dorsal fin.\nIn profile view, the head is long, and it has a straight muzzle and jawline, a large, almond-shaped eye (in profile), and a full, rounded nose and mouth. The top of the upright, pointed ear is visible at the poll. On the forehead lies a petal-shaped lock of hair. Behind it is an even ridge of short-cut mane that surmounts the arched neck, the hair depicted by regular, straight striations.\nThe obverse is convex, the reverse, slightly concave. On the obverse at the lower right are two smoothed craters, apparently resulting from the removal of faults. One is hemispherical, 7 mm in diameter, and the other, oblong, 10 mm across and 8 mm deep at its widest point.\nThe object has two sets of perforations: one, 3 mm in diameter, passes through the piece from the top of the forelock to the middle of the mane. The second, 2 mm in diameter, has exits in the mane (near the first perforation) and another near the coronet of the leg. A third, short perforation, 2 mm in diameter, intersects with the latter one from a hole near the pastern. When the pendant was suspended, the nose would have been nearly vertical. The perforation holes would have forced the pendant to face obverse side out when suspended.\nDiscussion This pendant is one of four amber pendants of hippocamps. A pendant in London (British Museum 73)1 shares with 78.AO.286.1 the same basic configuration of a coiled monster, but its style is different. BM 73 does not have the strong forelegs of the Getty Museum hippocamp. It is more snakelike and less subtly modeled, described instead with engraved lines. Both the London and Getty pendants have two sets of suspension perforations at the rostral end. When suspended, the creatures\u0026rsquo; heads are in a vertical position.2 An amber hippocamp pendant in the Metropolitan Museum of Art is perforated so that it hangs in a sejant position, much like that of a seahorse in motion.3 One of six amber pendants, now lost, which was excavated at Marzabotto in the nineteenth century, was thought to be a hippocamp.4 A hippocamp also may be represented on one side of an exceptionally large amber pendant in London (BM 38),5 the subject(s) of which remain unexplained. On the main side is a charioteer driving a four-horse chariot. The head of the distant horse on one side corresponds with that of the hippocamp on the other. On the reverse is a similar male figure (perhaps nude), who is perhaps struggling with a hippocamp, perhaps pulling in the creature, using his legs and feet to secure the slack in a thick rope, or, more likely, half-astride the creature, holding on for a wild ride. The subjects must be related since when the amber was newly carved, the image on one side would have been visible on the other, and there do not appear to be pre-Roman ambers with unrelated subjects. Do both sides show aspects of the cycle of the sun, the infant sun drawn by the charioteer (Apollo?) on the main side, and the nighttime passage of the sun beneath the ocean, drawn by the hippocamp on the reverse? The use of amber, a solar material with a waterborne phase in its formation, augments the iconography and magic of the image; this may help to explain the existence of other hippocampic carved ambers.\nThe horse part of 78.AO.286.1 is generally similar in style and type to horses painted on Middle and Late Corinthian vases and Early Attic black-figure wares. They share common features: heavy forelock, large profile eye with carefully outlined rims, full, rounded nose and mouth, large nostril, and diagonal grooves above the nose. The amber mane is shorter, however, than those of the horses on the painted examples. Illustrative sculpted parallels that bring out the Etruscanness of 78.AO.286.1 are the protomes (with perhaps hippocamp rather than equine forepart?) on various bronze, bucchero, and terracotta works. From the same family are the horse protomes of two bronze braziers from the Vulcian “Isis Tomb,” British Museum 436 and 437, dated by P. J. Riis to the second quarter of the sixth century,6 and other Vulcian bronze horse protomes, among them attachments to the tripod in Cap d\u0026rsquo;Agde.7 Comparison can also be drawn with the protomes of various bucchero vessels and offering trays (focolare)8 and with a terracotta of a horse head in Basel.9 The Getty hippocamp shares with the protome type of BM 437 the same rounded, curving neck, the short mane worked with fine striations, and a comparable form of eye. The head shape of BM 436 is closer to that of 78.AO.286.1. When suspended, the position of the London and Getty ambers is identical to that of the Vulcian brazier protomes.\nThe hippocamp first appeared in Etruria during the Orientalizing period and gained greater popularity in the Archaic.10 The monster as found in ancient art must owe something to the appearance of the tiny fishes (Hippocampus antiquorum) common in warm seas. There are far more representations of the hippocamp in the art of Etruria and South Italy than in that of the mainland and East Greece. Throughout the sixth century and into the fifth, the hippocamp appears in tomb paintings, on bronze vessels and stands, cinerary urns, and sarcophagi. It joins other sea monsters on Caeretan ceramics of the mid-sixth century. At first, marine creatures like the hippocamp and the sea dragon are dreadful and powerful monsters, inhabiting an unknown and dangerous place. Only heroes like Herakles or Perseus can defeat such marine monsters. This changes during the sixth century, when the hippocamp becomes an ally of humans and gods. In later times, the hippocamp is associated with Thetis, daughter of Nereus, mother of Achilles, and wife of Peleus. In Italian Hellenistic-period representations, the hippocamp is Thetis\u0026rsquo;s mount when she descends the oceans to get the armor of Achilles. (Is there a connection between Thetis\u0026rsquo;s steed and safe travel across the ocean to the Blessed Isles?)\nThe significant part played by the hippocamp in Etruscan and other Italian sepulchral symbolism is underlined by its frequent appearance on objects made purely for funerary purposes. The outstanding examples in Etruscan art date from the middle of the sixth century to the middle of the fifth and include the Etruscan stone figures of hippocamp riders, such as the famous example from Vulci in the Villa Giulia, of about 550;11 the hippocamps of Etruscan black-figure amphorae; and the images of hippocamps in Etruscan painted tombs. The best visual explanation of the amber hippocamps\u0026rsquo; meaning may be found in the Tomb of the Bulls\u0026rsquo; pedimental, heraldic composition of hippocamp riders racing toward a central island.12 In the fifth century in Etruria and elsewhere on the peninsula hippocampic imagery is joined by other hybrid beings of the sea. The message is the same, too, in fourth-century red-figure South Italian vases, Canosan vases, and in the gilded terracotta reliefs once ornamenting Tarantine sarcophagi.13\nFor the Etruscans, the hippocamp ferries the dead to the afterworld beyond the ocean. In tomb paintings, the hippocampic scenes are not simple allusions to the sea, as Jean-René Jannot emphasizes: “Painters used dolphins to evoke that element.… . It is highly probable that the hippocamps … served the function in Etruscan imagery of psychopompoi, guides for the dead.… These representations show death as a voyage toward an island Afterworld. The hinthial [soul, shade] rides the sea monsters across the sea (or ocean) toward a land where he will dwell.”14\nWhy a pendant in the form of a hippocamp? The subject\u0026rsquo;s Bronze Age antecedents (Mycenaean rather than Minoan) show how important the subject was for adornment and for seals, and for the grave. “The sea-horse is frequently found in the Mediterranean, and is mentioned by several ancient authors because of medicinal (or poisonous) properties that were imputed to it,” as Campbell Bonner writes.15 This must account in part for its presence on representations with (unexplained) magical significance. It might be assumed that the lore of the sea horse predated writing about it by Dioscorides and Galen. Whether worn in life or in death, a hippocamp carved from amber would bring together two aqueous and magical subjects. Amber, being naturally buoyant in ordinary water, could float in saltwater, and the hippocamp\u0026rsquo;s home was the salty sea. No matter which of the amber origin stories were current in sixth-century southern Etruria (where 78.AO.286.1 was likely carved or where it was buried), the amber was believed to have been produced by the action of solar powers combined with falling into a river or the ocean, before being carried onward. Amber, before carving, had already experienced a successful watery voyage.\nThe undulating forms of both the Getty and British Museum hippocamp pendants recall both the natural form of the fossil resin and the movement of water and suggest that the carver incorporated the original shape of the raw amber into the carvings. The subject may even have originated in the appearance of the nodule. The New York hippocamp, in contrast, is much more like contemporary sculpted and painted examples. When newly worked, 78.AO.286.1 would have been an arresting sight: because of the waterlike translucency of the amber, the head, front legs, and long tail would be visible all at the same time. Worn on the body, a couchant hippocamp, its eyes open in quiet watchfulness, might have conjured up the sea, its myriad dangers, and the necessity of a guardian monster. The hippocamp, as a demonic creature, was a protective, danger-averting subject, which could work on the amuletic principle of “like banishes like.” Additionally, the hippocampic pendants might have functioned by assimilation, that is, they were worn with the hope of acquiring the nature of the hippocamp and thus gaining access to its characteristics and particular powers. As a sea creature, the hippocamp was likely believed to have the gift of prophecy, as Emily Vermeule reminds us:\n Almost all sea-creatures have the gift of prophecy. It may be minor and limited, but some who were born with the beginning of the world, \u0026gt; older than the Olympian gods (Hesiod, Theogony 131, 233), had vast aboriginal experience combined with knowledge of the intense constant changes of the sea under wind and sun, and their prophetic power had an authority which land oracles and newer gods \u0026gt; could not rival. It was a knowledge of multiple possibilities, of transformations, mutations, and grandeur because it was not limited to the simple affairs of men on land. 16\n Notes   Citation: Strong 1966Strong, D.

Strong thought the youth on the reverse side to be nude, riding the hippocamp, and unrelated to the subject of the main side. He considers the style to be “closely connected with Etruscan work and this may be explained … if we suppose it was made in Campania or under the influence of Etrusco-Campanian art.” For this author, the amber reveals a close link with the art of Southern Etruria, and is characteristic of “Ionian” works from the last quarter of the sixth century. The hippocamp tamer evokes both Iolaos grasping one of the Hydra\u0026rsquo;s necks on the Getty Caeretan hydria (83.AE.346) and some of the cavorting comasts on the Getty “Campana” Group dinos (83.AE.249), both wares “probably the product of East Greek (Ionian) artists working in southern Etruria”: R.

Paul Getty Museum, 1979.\nCondition The pendant is intact with the exception of a large fracture loss to the nose and chips between the ears. The surface is smooth and firm. Minute surface crack patterns are visible on the dorsal surface and the ventral side. Before acquisition by the donor, the pendant was consolidated with a coating material that likely cemented together the consolidant, the yellow-ocher degraded amber, and soil, probably unintentially. The amber is opaque and brownish yellow in ambient light, except at the break, where the rich red translucency of the interior is exposed. There are no visible inclusions.\nDescription This teardrop-shaped pendant is an amalgamation of two sculptural forms, a crouching hare and a cowrie (Cypraeidae), modeled on the adult shell of the mollusk. The body of the hare is elevated from the ventral surface by a sort of platform. This is the edge of the cowrie shell. The rounded form of the pendant is a conflation of the hare\u0026rsquo;s back and the swelling of the cowrie\u0026rsquo;s dorsal surface. The hare is wide at the shoulders and narrow at the rump. Neither the front nor the hind legs are indicated. The hare\u0026rsquo;s ears are long, point straight backward, and lay flatly on the animal\u0026rsquo;s head. Its almond-shaped eyes are carefully incised, tapering to a point at the outer canthus. The ventral surface is smoothed but not flat; it curves gently upward at the base of the cowrie\u0026rsquo;s anterior canal and at the edge. The aperture is represented as a long groove.\nThe pendant retains evidence of the prepared amber blank from which it was carved. The indentation on the left side of the hare\u0026rsquo;s body and the three declivities in the ventral surface (each approximately 6 mm wide by 7 mm in length) are likely the result of the prefiguration removal of imperfections. The amber\u0026rsquo;s natural form, perhaps originally a large drop, may have directed the figuration. Its shape may also have conditioned the position and shape of the hare\u0026rsquo;s eyes. The use of the graver is seen in the working of the eyes, the articulation of the long groove of the ventral surface, and the groove separating the body from the base.\nThe pendant was suspended by a perforation that passes laterally through the cheeks of the hare; the exit holes are each 2 mm in diameter. When suspended, the animal would have faced upward, its back facing the viewer.\nDiscussion This pendant is an extraordinary combination of four things, amber, a recumbent hare, a cowrie shell (the ventral side mimics the aperture), and when hanging, the shape (in silhouette) of the Egyptian sign of the East, the flame of the new sun\u0026rsquo;s light. The lustrousness of the fossil resin echoes that of the shell and its transparency the light of the sun. Like amber, the cowrie was highly valued for its rarity, distinctive colors, and luster; like the cowrie, amber had a marine aspect: amber was made, found, or transported by water, and some specimens may still have included encrustation of shells. Amber is like the color of the sun and a flame.\nCowrie is the common name applied to marine gastropods belonging to the Cypraeidae, a large family of marine snails abundant in the Indian Ocean, particularly in the East Indies and the Maldive Islands. (Cowries are also found off the coast of Southern California.) They characteristically have massive, smooth, shiny shells with striking patterns and colors. As is the case today, only some species of cowrie were highly prized (and imitated) in the ancient world; the most sought after then as now are those deemed “exotic,” that is, particularly rare, lustrous, or distinctly colored.1 Cowries were traded to Egypt as early as the fifth millennium B.C., and cowrie-shaped pendants used as ornaments are documented as early as the late Old Kingdom period in Egypt. The much-valued cowrie shell inspired various kinds of jewelry, direct transfers in hollow electrum, gold, and silver,2 as well as the cowroid (a mixture of the scarab and the cowrie), in which the scarab back was replaced with the cowrie shell and the underside engraved.3\nCowrie-shaped amber pendants are among the most popular of all pendant shapes in pre-Roman Italy and are among the first subjects to appear in amber, the earliest dating to the late eighth century. Amber cowries gained popularity in the seventh century in Etruria, the mid-Adriatic, and in the south of Italy and remained popular until the end of the fifth century, when the shell was imitated in silver and in gold.4 Amber cowrie-shaped pendants come in all sizes, from 20 to 90 mm in length, and range in their degree of naturalism. Some pendants are schematic; others include greater morphological detail, as is the case with 79.AO.75.28. The evidence from controlled excavations of Orientalizing-period sites in South Italy shows that amber cowroids are documented exclusively in female graves, where they were the primary elements of necklaces and girdles. Other uses are documented, however. A unique pectoral with cowries and tiny female figures was buried with a woman in a grave at Ascoli Piceno.5 A late seventh-/early sixth-century grave (Tomb 315) at Alianello-Cazzaiola documents another unusual use: the deceased woman was buried with an elaborate headband composed of small disk-shaped beads of ivory, bone, amber, and faïence, as well as with Egyptian faïence scarabs, real cowries, and a small amber imitation cowrie.6\nThe Getty cowrie-hare is one of four amber cowroid pendants known to me. A unique combination is the pendant from Tursi, dated to the first half of the eighth century, which incorporates a cowrie and a scarab (but differently than in Egypt): the back of the Italic amber is a scarab and the underside that of a cowrie.7 The others are a cowrie-hare pendant in the Metropolitan Museum of Art,8 a schematically rendered cowrie/crouching hare, teardrop-shaped and with a plain underside in a London private collection,9 and three hare-subject pendants in a German private collection.10 The Getty, New York, and London hare-cowrie pendants are all relatively close in size, although each is different in style and shows variations in form. The New York cowrie-hare is the most naturalistic: the raised base at the anterior canal of the cowrie, the distinctive caudal elongation of the hare\u0026rsquo;s head, and the rangy muscularity of the long body are faithfully captured.\nThis trio is related to the amber frog-cowrie pendants found at Vetulonia and to an example (now in the British Museum) said to come from Armento.11 A similar pendant was once in the Stroganoff collection,12 and another (allegedly from Metaponto) is recorded as once being on the art market.13 As with the scarab-cowrie combination, these hare-cowrie and frog-cowrie pendants bring together powerful subjects with age-old fertility, protection, and regenerative significance in amber, a material with the same properties.\nThe silhouette of this pendant, and of cowrie-shaped pendants in general, forms the shape of the Egyptian flame of sunlight, the sign of the East. The Egyptian flame accompanies the infant sun, the East, the direction of the sunrise and rebirth, an important step in the formation of the world.14\nIn Egypt, from the late Old Kingdom through the Late Period, both males and females wore hare and frog amulets, but the cowrie seems to have been worn exclusively by women.15 In Italy, the hare as a subject of adornment may have had resonance for both men and women; it might have symbolized a specific divinity, Dionysos, Artemis, or another female goddess of nature or the hunt. The hare and frog were both associated with fertility, but a hare pendant might have had an additional significance in the tomb, offering its wearer special sight even in the dark, speed (away from danger and for fast passage through the afterworld), and the possibilities of rebirth.16 The symbolic meaning of the hare in the iconographic tradition of Syria (the ultimate source of Phoenician hare images?) “grew out of its biotope (animal of the open fields and desert) on the one hand, and out of its stunning reproductive capacity (the superfecundatio was known since antiquity) on the other hand.”17 “Hare amulets may have stood for the vital forces connected with fertility … alert quickness, and swiftness of the animal, and are to be viewed as life-giving symbols.”18 (See Divinity Holding Hares, Citation: 77.AO.82Cat. no. 4, cat. no. 4), for additional discussion of the hare as a symbol.)\nThe mature cowrie has been likened in appearance to the human eye and female genitalia, both powerful danger-averting subjects.19 The cowrie shell has been used to “replace” the eyes of the deceased and in Egypt and Italy is especially important for women. The long and narrow aperture on the underside of the cowrie recalls the external appearance of the vulva, and with the animal emerging from it, birth itself. The overall shape of the shell may have been thought to intimate the shape of the womb, “so when beads of its shape formed an element of a woman\u0026rsquo;s girdle, they were in exactly the right place to ward off evil influences from the relevant bodily part of the wearer, especially if she were pregnant.”20\nThe function of a cowrie amulet would have been to enhance the particular bodily functions of the organs it represented (the eyes or the genitalia) and to act as a substitute for them in the afterworld. The amber, itself magic and regenerative, no doubt enhanced the fertility properties of the cowrie, as did the image of the proverbially fertile hare. That the hare and cowrie are two species in which the females are larger than the males must have added to the amuletic aspects of the pendant. In the tomb, the combination of hare and cowrie in a beautiful ornament-amulet might have been especially valuable for protection in rebirth or for the journey to the afterworld. In the beliefs of some in ancient Italy, this was a complicated voyage, part by land, part by sea, and part submarine.21\nNotes   Citation: White 1992White, R. “Beyond Art: Towards an Understanding of the Origins of Material Representations in Europe.” Annual Review of Anthropology 21 (1992): 537–64., p. 549, theorizing a source–distance gradient for Aurignacian-period personal ornaments, underlines that they are usually manufactured of materials exotic to the regions in which they are found. This continues to hold true for the prehistoric period and early historic period in Italy for amuletic and exotic materials, such as amber, ivory, and cowries. S. Shennen, “Amber and Its Value in the British Bronze Age,” in Citation: Beck and Bouzek 1993Beck, C. W., and J. Bouzek, eds.

Prague, 1993., pp. 62–66, discusses amber\u0026rsquo;s value, especially in light of its acquisition by political-religious elites living spatially distant from amber sources and cites Citation: Helms 1988Helms, M. W. Ulysses’ Sail: An Ethnographic Odyssey of Power, Knowledge, and Geographical Distance. Princeton, 1988., p. 114: “Many exchanged items have inherent magical or religious significance as ‘powercharged’ treasures acquired from extraordinary realms outside their own heartland.” Indeed, as Citation: Helms 1988Helms, M. W. Ulysses’ Sail: An Ethnographic Odyssey of Power, Knowledge, and Geographical Distance. Princeton, 1988. concludes on p. 130: “The ultimate goal of those seeking [shields or shell or stones or holy incense, or amber] may well be directed toward obtaining (maintaining) access to material manifestations of the power and potency that imbues their cosmos, thereby continuing their close association and inclusion with the dynamics of the universe of which they are an integral part.” This idea is more fully developed in M. W. Helms\u0026rsquo;s Access to Origins: Affines, Ancestors and Aristocrats (Austin, 1998).\nThe cowrie was associated with fertility and the sea, whose tides are controlled by the moon, the effect of which on women was well established. For this reason, among others, the moon is associated with many female fertility divinities in the Mediterranean, among them Artemis (with whom amber is also closely linked). An amber cowrie could be seen as a material manifestation of the dynamics of the universe.\n↩ An early outstanding example is the girdle formed of gold cowries belonging to Queen Mereret (Dynasty 12) in the Cairo Museum; see, for example, Citation: Andrews 1994Andrews, C.

Amber scarabs were among the first carved amber objects to appear in Italy in the Orientalizing period, with many excavated examples. Although many demonic subjects of Egyptian and Near Eastern origin appear to have lost or changed their meaning as the visual forms were adapted in Greece, Etruria, and elsewhere in Italy, the scarab seems never to have lost its original associations with the sun, life, and regeneration. The early amber scarabs and scaraboids are evidence of this. See A. F.

The effluent fertility of both frogs and toads (rarely differentiated in Egypt, according to Andrews) apparently led to their association with fertility generally and the renewal of life after death. The frog was seen as a chthonic animal that alluded to the forces which brought life into being. The goddess Heket, who manifested herself in the shape of a frog or as a woman with a frog\u0026rsquo;s head, was also associated with childbirth. The goddess had “participated in the creation of the divine child, crouched beside the potter\u0026rsquo;s wheel on which Khnum shaped the small naked immortal, [and thus] all frog amulets might be intended to represent the goddess in her animal manifestation”: Citation: Andrews 1994Andrews, C.

In addition to its rarity and lustrous beauty, other reasons why the cowrie accrued amuletic powers include the fact that the females of the Cypraeidae family are larger than the males; the shells secrete a purple staining liquid; and that the life cycle of the cowrie included a development metaphorically similar to that of female genitalia. Some cowries have coloration that looks like the skin of spotted cats, some have “eyes,” and some of the rarest cowrie species are thought to resemble female genitalia. (Culled from R. J.

Paul Getty Museum, 1976.\nCondition The pendant is intact, with a smooth, firm surface in most areas. The tip of the nose, the right side of the animal\u0026rsquo;s muzzle, and the two distal digits of the right forepaw are broken off. There are also small breaks on the right haunch and foreleg. Small chips and pitting occur on both the dorsal and ventral surfaces and on the animal\u0026rsquo;s sides. Some of the pitted areas contain yellowish degraded material. The amber is crazed all over. Near the right shoulder blade is a large inclusion that is also visible on the ventral surface. This piece is translucent and dull reddish brown in ambient light and pale ruby-red in transmitted light. After entry into the museum, the pendant was mechanically cleaned and then treated with an amber oil distillate that increased translucency and darkened the color.\nDescription The lion is dorsally convex and ventrally concave, full through the upper body, with the right shoulder area thickest in volume. There is a noticeable asymmetry of form, with the body and head curving slightly toward the left and the right lower leg protruding outward. Delicate sculptural transitions in the abdomen area suggest its softness. Subtle modulations in the carving indicate the subcutaneous structure of the shoulders and back. Between the root of the tail and the hocks on the underside is a long declivity, made when the amber was being prepared for carving. The thick tubular tail begins its curve to the left, courses right, and curves again to the left, with the tip of the tail lying on the right flank. The tip of the tail has four lobes.\nThe lion is positioned with all four legs drawn up under the body, the right front paw placed under the chin and the left curled up under the chest. The left foreleg is represented in side view, the outer two toes in overlapped profile, while the right front foreleg and paw are straight and the footpad flat. The right foreleg is unusual in that its dewclaw is indicated, as a modeled zigzag indentation. The hind legs draw close together against the abdomen, the haunches, and legs as though in profile, the feet flattened, with all of the toe pads in a line. Each of the four feet has four large hemispherical toe pads.\nThe lion\u0026rsquo;s forehead has a deep medial indentation and two lateral indentations sweeping back to the mane. The almond eyes are set back, deep set under the eyebrow ridges, which flow in a naturalistically undulating line to the wide cheekbones. Despite the losses to the top of the pendant, the nose can still be traced. Just above the break, there are two horizontal wrinkles. The muzzle, mouth, and chin are smoothly defined, with a groove for the mouth. The upper lip has two bulbous undulations on the surviving side and it overlaps the lower one. The chin is short, and the throat is subtly carved to suggest the underlying anatomy. A shallow groove separates the face from the mane. The mane itself is bilaterally divided, with the median line of the forehead continued into the fur. Heavy tufts of the mane are separated into a somewhat symmetrical array. The mane hangs down onto the sides of the figure\u0026rsquo;s head and continues onto the shoulders and chest. On the ventral surface, above the left upper leg, five hanks of hair are rendered. Large, softly modeled, and folded ears commence at the front edge of the mane and are tipped upward. The antihelix is represented as a raised fillet.\nThe curve of the lion\u0026rsquo;s body, the thinness of the pendant, the concavity of the ventral side and convexity of the dorsal, and features such as the declivity on the flank of the animal indicate the general outlines of the original shape of the amber blank. It was likely carved from an amber sheet (see introduction).\nEvidence of manufacture includes the scrape marks located on the larger planes of the legs, back, and ventral surfaces. Around the eyes and in between the hanks of the mane are traces of a graver. Multidirectional abrasion marks are found near the transitions between body parts, such as the intersection of haunch and body.\nThe break in the muzzle offers a clear view of a triangular set of perforations for suspension: there is a cross-bore just below the top of the nose bridge and two perforations connected to an exit hole at the tip of the nose. Suspended from a filament in the cross-bore, the lion would have hung with its head uppermost, its body curving slightly downward to the right. The medial line of the lion\u0026rsquo;s mane would have been roughly perpendicular to the ground.\nDiscussion 76.AO.78 belongs to a larger group of Archaic and sub-Archaic amber animals carved fully in the round in the shape of resting animals and demonic creatures—lions, rams, bulls, goats, gazelles; and hippocamps, human-headed bulls (Achelous), sirens, and sphinxes. The compositions emphasize the dorsal and ventral sides of the animals. Their faces are flush with the ventral plane, one or both paws are beneath the chin (or lower jaw), and both pairs of legs are drawn up close to the body. The more convex side is used for the animal\u0026rsquo;s back. No two of these are alike because in each one the animal is accommodated to the peculiarities of the amber nodule. When the pendants were new and the amber translucent, the features of one side would have been blurrily visible from the other, inviting handling so as to see the figures from every angle. The pendants would have needed to be turned over in order to see the entire animal, especially the sculptural tour de force of the curled-under paw.\nOf this type of amber animal pendant, the couchant lion is the most numerous. The group includes, in addition to 76.AO.78, two pendants in Numana from a tomb at Sirolo; one from a recent find at Bologna (Tomb 12); two pendants in London, British Museum 64 and 65; one in Copenhagen; one each in private collections in Hamburg, New York, and London; and two on the art market, one in London and the other in Basel.1 A lion nearly identical to BM 65 is part of a group of a lion attacking prey, the bow decoration of a bronze fibula from Tomb 72 at Belmonte Piceno. Related in format is a pendant in the form of a feline ( Citation: 77.AO.81.8Cat. no. 32, cat. no. 32) and two other fibula bow decorations from Tomb 72 at Belmonte Piceno, one of a lion attacking a deer and the other in the form of a pair of addorsed lions\u0026rsquo; heads.2\nThe pendant closest to 76.AO.78 is BM 64. The correlations include the overall conception of the design, the treatment of the volumes, the subtle transitions from one plane to another, and individual details such as the placement of body and limbs on the amber nodule, and the curve of the tail. Next in kin is BM 65, which is, however, less organically modeled and more simplified in key details such as the mane and the number of toe pads (it has three each to the four of 76.AO.78) and in the flange, a bead-and-reel device at the rump that would have suspended the pendant head downward. These are enough alike in lion type and format that it might be hypothesized that they descend from a common sculptural invention, one close to 76.AO.78. The other lions\u0026rsquo; heads are carved in a more schematic manner, flatter, and harsher, and perhaps likely descend from a variant model or prototype.\nThe style of 76.AO.78 (and its closest relations) is elucidated by comparison to objects in various scales and media, but especially to large-scale marble sculpture. It is similar to a number of Archaic marble lions from the Greek East and Lydia,3 with one of the best parallels, the fragmentary marble lion\u0026rsquo;s head from Ephesus in the British Museum.4 76.AO.78 shares with these marble lions an analogous formation of the head, a comparable fine-featured, slightly pointed face, similar modeling, especially around the eyes, and most noticeably, a parallel treatment of the long mane locks. Characteristically, the manes of this group are divided into coifed hanks rendered as separate, plastically modeled lobes. In the arrangement around the head and on the back, the design varies from a full petal-like blanketing to a bifurcated overlap patterning. 76.AO.78 has in common with a complete marble lion from Miletos in Berlin and a fragmentary lion from Miletos in Paris5 an exposure of the ventral surface of the paws and the same rounded flame-shaped hanks of the mane.\nThe hypothetical prototype of 76.AO.78 is as likely one of amber as of ivory and was probably the work of a South Ionian artisan, or someone trained in an ambient where the language and techniques of South Ionian sculpture were alive. This and the likely late-sixth- to early-fifth-century date of 76.AO.78 argue for manufacture in the west, in Italy. So does the material: it is in these decades that large pieces of jewelry-grade amber were used for ornament-amulets found in Etruria and the areas bordering it—in the mid-Adriatic, Campania, and parts of inland south Italy. Manufacture on the west rather than the east coast of the peninsula is supported by similarity to some Campanian small bronze lions and to the lions incorporated into the top of the handles of several types of Etruscan bucchero vessels.6 The lions\u0026rsquo; backs emerging from the surface are remarkably similar in conception.\nOnly the provenance of the fibula lions from Tomb 72, Belmonte Piceno, is established. British Museum 64 and 65, from the Sir William Temple bequest, are said to have come from Armento—the same alleged provenance as three other stylistically related amber pendants from the Temple bequest, the “Man-headed bull-couchant (Achelous),” (BM 68), a couchant sphinx (BM 69), and a couchant gazelle (BM 70).7 In turn, this ex-Temple group is stylistically related to the large sphinx pendant from Tomb 102 at Braida di Vaglio, a burial of circa 500.8 While Belmonte Piceno, Armento (if the provenance is accurate), and Braida di Vaglio were the final resting places, they are not necessarily the places of manufacture of these ambers. In this author\u0026rsquo;s view, the carved ambers under discussion are Etruscan or Campanian, made by an artisan from South Ionia, or under the strong influence of a South Ionian invention.\nThe tradition of representing small sculptures of resting animals and creatures carved fully in the round was age-old by the sixth century. Amulets in this format are documented in third-millennium Sumerian and Egyptian graves. Related to such imagery are the contorted and whirling animals, such as trussed antelopes or geese, cut into Bronze Age Aegean seals or Egyptian containers or the ritual utensils (spoons or containers) shaped as a swimming nude woman or as a running dog. Parallels among objects closer in date to 76.AO.78 and the related amber animal subjects are the amber pendants that represent sirens and other flying anthromorphs. Their antecedents are perhaps the precious metal pendants of birds and flying figures, such as the seventh-century owls from Ephesos or the bee-goddesses from Kameiros.9\nHowever, the contemporary precious objects most like 76.AO.78 and the amber resting animals carved fully in the round are a number of extraordinary Greek gems (dating from the late sixth century onward) of equidae in unusual poses, among them rolling and falling horses and centaurs shown in various activities.10 The horse-subject gemstones found in Cyprus, East Greece, and the Greek islands,11 and the seventh-century Ephesian and Rhodian gold pendants may point to the area of origin for the sculpted “invention” behind 76.AO.78 and its relatives. It is not only the pose, the sculptural accomplishment, and the nature of the subject that link these diverse classes of objects. They also have in common a similar sculptural approach, softness in the anatomical description, minimal use of line, and a smoothing of the planar transitions, all of which underline the artistic connection.\nThe lion of 76.AO.78 conflates many aspects of a lion\u0026rsquo;s behavior: the elongated body, the lowered head, and crouching hind legs suggest that the animal is lying in wait, ready to pounce; its ears are laid back, the nose wrinkled, indications of the animal\u0026rsquo;s ferocity. Yet the closed mouth and the curled right paw belie imminent action.\nSuch an image may have conjured up the power of the deities of the wild, and the heroes and gods who conquered the animal. When the object was worn, the wearer may have taken on by assimilation the power of such a vanquisher. On one level, a lion amulet might have brought to its wearer the celebrated power, bravery, and ferocity of the legendary animal (probably never seen by any of the amber lion carvers). By assimilation, it may have endowed its wearers with the same qualities. A lion amulet might incorporate danger-averting and protective functions for the owner. The lion of 76.AO.78 is vigilant, a guardian and protector, and as an amulet, it would have been powerful both in life and death. However, might also the lion amber pendants have incorporated in them aspects of more ancient customs? In Mesopotamia, the lion was a favorite metaphor in literature for warlike kings and fierce deities. In the Neo-Assyrian period, the natural lion was considered “a generally magically protective type, known as urgulû.”12\nIn Egypt, the lion was a symbol of the sun-god Ra, and by extension a symbol of the god Amun. As a desert dweller, the lion was believed to have regenerative capabilities and as such was an essential amulet for the dead. If the amber lion pendants incorporate Egyptian symbolism (as well as aspects of Egyptian style), what better material for them than amber, a solar substance? What better form than a tear?\nAt the time of their making or burial, these amber lions may have been described with the Etruscan or Italic equivalent of the Latin fulvum (English: tawny, like the hides of wild animals), which Pliny records was used to describe one kind of amber.\nTwo of the lion ambers indicate how they might be worn in the grave: the Ancona lion formed the bow of a bronze fibula, and we might assume was worn on the upper part of the deceased\u0026rsquo;s body. The smaller lion in the London private collection was one of three amber pendants hanging from a hip-encircling reticulated amber girdle. In both cases, the location (and the method of attachment) could have focused the amuletic powers of the ambers. The lion pin would guard the heart and soul; the girdle pendant would protect the pelvic region. For the latter, a Late Antique prescription used in “aggressive magic” is relevant: amulets with the head of a lion were believed to have the ability to calm the womb (the roaring of the lion counteracting the “roaring” of the womb) and were to be worn in its proximity.13\nNotes   Both of the Bologna lions come from female grave contexts of the late sixth-early fifth centuries.

Paul Getty Museum, 1977.\nCondition The pendant is intact except for small losses to the left lower jaw and center of the chest. The surface is crazed and cracking, with flakes missing from the cortex. Before entry into the donor\u0026rsquo;s collection, the pendant was mechanically cleaned and treated with a thickly applied surface consolidant that added shine to the surface. In ambient light, the pendant is light brown, and in transmitted light, red-brown. The untouched surface inside the perforations may indicate the appearance of the amber before treatment.\nDescription The original shape of the amber blank may be reflected in the compact, droplike shape of the pendant. The bottom is flat, the top convex, tapering at the nose end. The animal is stretched out, with her open-eyed head placed on her paws. The head and body curve slightly to the right, with the animal\u0026rsquo;s left shoulder and leg extended farther on the left. The head is square, with a full forehead that gently slopes to the bridge of the nose, a flat muzzle, and small mouth. The jaws are square. Dividing the head from the body at the thick neck is an engraved line. From it spring two triangular ears. The animal\u0026rsquo;s back is full and rounded, arching all the way through the lumbar region. The front and back legs have a similar shape. The haunches are drawn forward, with the lower legs next to the abdomen and advanced past the point of the knee to midbody. The lower back legs are comparatively thin and angular, with long, hooklike feet. In comparison, the front feet are small. The left lower leg is further forward under the head; an object may be held beneath it. The five pairs of large dugs lie in neat rows.\nBecause of the state of preservation and the chemical treatment of the amber, only the traces of engraved lines are witness to the pendant\u0026rsquo;s manufacture. A perforation with holes each 2 mm in diameter passes directly under the neck in line with the root of the ears. If suspended by the boring through the head, the animal would have hung head upward; if a suspension device were attached to the holes in the rump, it would have hung nose downward. A pair of stopped bores, each 2 mm in diameter, are located at each side of the tail to a depth of about 3 mm. Below the left side of the lower lip is a similar bore, 2 mm in diameter and about 2.5 mm deep.\nDiscussion Feline, dog, sow, or hare? The physiognomic characteristics of 77.AO.81.8 are not like that of any animal, or of any ancient representation of an animal, known to me. It has no parallels within the corpus of pre-Roman carved amber. Nevertheless, in its general format, 77.AO.81.8 is similar to many other types of amber in the form of dormant animals—for example, Citation: 76.AO.78Cat. no. 31 (cat. no. 31), to name one Getty pendant. The curve of the upper part of the animal\u0026rsquo;s body, the short, fat body, and the positioning of the right paws are similar to a group of Orientalizing amber dog pendants,1 and to many Archaic amber lions. As noted in the entry for Citation: 76.AO.78Cat. no. 31, the ancestral schema of the amber lions may be Mycenaean. 77.AO.81.8 is particularly close to an extant pendant, the gold couchant lion from Tomb 5 at Hagia Triada (circa 1500–1450).2 This said, the form of the head and ears, the manner in which the animal crouches, and the dugs invite comparison to a small group of Orientalizing representations of felines. (The legs and feet of 77.AO.81.8, however, are more lagomorphic than leonine.) The short, curled tail is the one big difference between 77.AO.81.8 and Citation: 76.AO.78Cat. no. 31 and the other related amber felines (as well as the comparable Bronze Age gold lions). Although a few Etruscan felines appear to have short tails,3 the short curly tail of 77.AO.81.8 is more like that of a pig, or some breeds of dog, including the Canis familiaris Studer, the smooth-haired, big, heavy dog with small ears represented in Mesopotamian art.4\nThe stopped bores near the jaw area and to either side of the tail are equally without parallel. They were likely used for attachments, perhaps a collar at the neck if the animal is a dog, or for the attachment of pendants (nursing young?). The prominence of the milk-laden breasts of the amber animal emphasizes the fertility and regenerative aspects of the pendant amulet. If it represents a dog, there may have been an association with guardianship, protection, and healing. The ancient Near Eastern association of the dog with Gula, “the great physician,” is allied to the later importance of the dog in the iconography and cult of the healers Apollo Asgelatas and Asclepius.5 Some Late Period amulet types of Egyptian glazed-composition sows (the sky goddess Nut, or Isis?) were intended to endow their wearers with fecundity.6 Comparable, Archaic Etruscan painted representations, such as the felines painted on vases (primarily found in tombs) by the Micali Painter, or the mammiferous feline painted on the walls of the Tomb of the Lionesses at Tarquinia, where the lioness not only acts as mediator but also as nurse.7 Nigel Spivey suggests that the lactating felines of Etruscan funerary art allude to breastfeeding, to the feeding of children, to the infantile condition, to rebirth and that the passage to the afterworld is expressed simply by a return to the infantile state.8 J. Bulté shows how in Egypt, images of a lactating lioness (or of a figure with a feline body and a human head) were not uncommon as the subject of faïence (glazed-composition) amulets, which she shows to be associated with a happy maternity (“l\u0026rsquo;heureuse maternité”).9 A lactating feline carved from amber must have been a powerful amulet, one in which the fertility associations and regenerative aspects of the material were enhanced by the subject (especially if the attachments were tiny kittens).\nNotes   For the small amber dogs, see Citation: 82.AO.161.2Cat. no. 27 (cat. no. 27). ↩ Heraklion Museum 140 (from Tomb 5 at Hagia Triada): Citation: Higgins 1980Higgins, R.

The Getty collection reflects the relative popularity of these two animal subjects: there are four lions’ and fifteen rams’ heads. A feature found on almost all the amber animal heads is the collarlike finial section in imitation of a metal mount, which shows that the amber examples imitate pendants made entirely of gold (or another precious metal) or of another material such as ivory set in a metal mount.\nThe list of amber lions’ heads now includes the four examples in the Getty Museum— Citation: 76.AO.80Cat. no. 33 (cat. no. 33), Citation: 76.AO.81Cat. no. 34 (cat. no. 34), Citation: 77.AO.81.9Cat. no. 35 (cat. no. 35), and Citation: 77.AO.81.10Cat. no. 36 (cat. no. 36)—and a pair now serving as the finials of two gold bracelets of Hellenistic date in the Louvre, findspot unknown;1 a pair from an amber-rich find at Novi Pazar, St. Peter’s Church (Etruscan? late sixth century), and a single lion’s head from a tomb at Atenica of the same date;2 a single(?) lion’s head from Canosa(?) in London (British Museum 78);3 and the dozen or more tiny lions’ heads on three Etruscan necklaces, one from a controlled excavation and two others on the New York art market said to be from Etruria.4 On each necklace, the lions’ heads are joined by an equal number of rams’ heads and plain beads.\nParallels for the amber heads include complete amber lions, as Donald Strong noted about a lion’s head in the British Museum,5 and lion foreparts pendants, one excavated with context from the girl’s Tomb 102 at Braida di Vaglio, near Melfi,6 and another from Armento, now in London.7\nThere is a difference between these Late Archaic lions and the earlier, sixth-century examples in the Getty and elsewhere (i.e., Citation: 77.AO.81.2Cat. no. 5, cat. no. 5, Citation: 77.AO.81.3Cat. no. 6, cat. no. 6, and two in Paris). The later Etruscan and other Italian-made lions of the Late Archaic are characteristically a mélange: the style is a complex blend not borrowed from any one source.8 The earliest amber lions’ heads in the Getty, and a related few amber examples, demonstrate visibly their Oriental antecedents—their Assyrian, Hittite, and East Greek connections. In the case of Citation: 76.AO.80Cat. no. 33 and Citation: 76.AO.81Cat. no. 34, the Assyrian elements are salient through comparison to the beasts of Ashurbanipal. The East Greek elements are brought out by comparison to marble lions such as those from Miletos and Ephesus,9 to an East Greek terracotta vessel in the shape of a lion protome,10 and to various carved gems and tiny ivories. Of the latter, salient comparisons are the lions (and lions’ heads) engraved on a number of Ionian Greek gemstones, notably a plasma scarab signed by Aristoteiches,11 and a pair of Ionian ivory lions’ heads from Smêla, whose eyes are inset with amber.12 The longevity of the Ionian lion types in adornment might be exemplified by the finials of a pair of late-fourth-century silver bracelets with gold lions’ heads from Pantikopaion, now in St. Petersburg.13\nComparable Etruscan contemporary lions’ heads in other media (which have known provenances) come from southern Etruria, mainly Vulci, but also from Cerveteri, Orvieto, and Tarquinia. These include the tiny gold finials of a blue glass bracelet from Vulci,14 gold pendants in Berlin and Paris,15 and the larger lions’ heads of hammered bronze, especially an example from Orvieto, now in Boston.16 The above-noted examples have in common a similar anatomical form, a similar modeling of the eye area, tipped-up noses, deeply carved mouths, and comparable ferocious expressions. The Orvieto bronze is remarkably like Citation: 76.AO.80Cat. no. 33 in the length, depth, and form of the head, and in the schema of the dagged mane ruff.\nThe only extant painting of lions’ heads is found on one of the many necklaces and garlands hanging from the branches of the sacred grove painted in the first chamber of the Tarquinian Tomb of Hunting and Fishing. The painted lions’ heads correspond closely with extant contemporary gold, ivory, and amber lions’ heads. This depiction suggests an amuletic or religious function for the objects.17 Demonic forces are attracted and repelled; propitious forces are invited.\nAs noted above, a lion of amber combined a potent subject in a potent material, one where the magical aspects of amber and subject, the color of the material and the representation, were matched up. Lion and amber were from earliest times associated with the sun, as was much-prized carnelian, which is very like amber in appearance. Carnelian was traditionally employed in Egypt for pendants of lions’ heads and lions’ foreparts.18 Most early Greek and Etruscan gemstones of lion subjects are also carnelian. A subject—such as the lion—that enhanced the inherent danger-averting, protective, and regenerative aspects of these solar materials might have been a straightforward choice.\nAmber lions’ heads likely served as permanent amulets, that is, as both ornament and magical object. For almost two thousand years before the series of amber and gold head-pendants were produced, lions, lions’-head, and lion-foreparts amulets similar to them in schema and materials had been popular in Egypt. As the symbol of the sun-god, Ra, the lion was, by extension, a symbol of the pharaoh. Worn in life, a lion-subject amulet could symbolize fierceness and bravery, endowing its owner with the same qualities; thus, in life or in death it could function as a protective, danger-averting amulet. The lion-foreparts amulet, unique to the Egyptian late Old Kingdom and First Intermediate periods, was set at the neck to protect the deceased from a second death and endowed the owner with the ability to come forth from the realm of the dead and “become an excellent spirit.”19 The Egyptian beliefs in the regenerative capabilities of the lion (characteristic of all desert dwellers) are assumed to underlie the symbolism of the lions’-head amulets that were current from the late Old Kingdom through the Late Period.20 Both lion-foreparts and lions’-head types were almost exclusively carved from carnelian.\nBecause of the Assyrian typological and stylistic aspects of Citation: 76.AO.80Cat. no. 33, the important role played by the lion in adornment and architecture during the Neo-Assyrian period should be recalled: as noted above, the lion was a generally magically protective type (known as urgulû).21\nThere are demonstrable connections in Greek myth and the material culture of Greece among Apollo, the sun, and the lion. If the trees on the walls of the first chamber in the Tomb of Hunting and Fishing (introduction, fig. 38) depict Apollo’s sacred grove, as some scholars have posited, the necklace with (amber?) lions’-head pendants (and the necklace with rams’-head pendants hanging on another tree) may take on special import. If, however, the dancers of the Hunting and Fishing tomb are directly connected to Fufluns/Dionysos, the god of wine, as Sybille Haynes proposes, the tomb may illustrate Dionysian religiosity.22 In any case, the dance is apotropaic and purifacatory. In either interpretation, the lions’ and rams’ heads were appropriate to the painted events.23\nAlthough the Getty amber lions’ heads are generally similar in format and function to one another (as well as to amber heads in other collections and to protomes in other media), each is idiosyncratic. The Getty lions’ heads demonstrate both a close relationship to existing types and models and the distinctive hand of individual carvers. Citation: 76.AO.80Cat. no. 33, Citation: 77.AO.81.9Cat. no. 35, and Citation: 77.AO.81.10Cat. no. 36 are pendants, bored laterally in the neck area. Citation: 76.AO.81Cat. no. 34 is perforated with a large rostrocaudal through-bore and has a beveled edge. This indicates a usage different from all other amber lions’ heads. Citation: 76.AO.81Cat. no. 34 may have served as a finial, such as a finial bead on a necklace, the likely purpose of one of the amber ram pendants in the Getty collection ( Citation: 77.AO.81.12Cat. no. 52, cat. no. 52). However, the size of the hole and the delicacy of the carving of the lion’s mouth suggest other functions; possibly it served as the added spout of a small vessel. In addition to the pendants, there are two other amber lions’ heads in the Getty collection, the finials of Citation: 77.AO.83Cat. no. 38 (cat. no. 38), a plaque with a walking boar as its subject.\nNotes   For the lions’ heads in the Louvre, see Citation: Metzger 1991Metzger, C. “Noeud d\u0026rsquo;Héraclès et torsades: Trois bijoux hellénistiques.” Revue du Louvre 41 (1991): 18–23. and discussion under Citation: 77.AO.81.2Cat. no. 5 and Citation: 77.AO.81.3Cat. no. 6, above. ↩ For the material from Novi Pazar, St. Peter’s Church, and Atenica, see Citation: Palavestra and Krstić 2006Palavestra, A., and V.

Paul Getty Museum, 1976.\nCondition The pendant is in good condition, with a generally smooth surface. There is a large nonmodern chip behind the right side of the chin and four broken teeth; there are also many tiny modern chips, cracks, and crazing over the entire surface. Inclusions are visible in one crack on the right side of the neck. All over the surface are small blotches of a pale yellow-ocher patina. Degraded amber fills many of the fine cracks. The piece is dull brownish red in ambient light and bright red in transmitted illumination.\nDescription The pendant consists of the head and upper neck portion of a ferocious lion, mouth open wide, tongue extended, teeth bared, and ears flattened against the head. The forehead, medial indentation, areas around the eyes, and the top of the snout are richly modeled, suggesting a subcutaneous musculature (even if it is not anatomically correct). The eyes are rendered plastically, in profile appearing narrow and hooded and in frontal view open and rectangular, in a gaze of focused concentration. Emphasizing the raised elliptical domes of the eyeballs, their upper lids are undercut.\nThe pert nose is delineated by two outward-curving nasal wrinkles. The tip of the nose is flat on the frontal plane and tilted upward in profile. A raised philtrum separates the halves of the muzzle; the wrinkled snarl lines on either side are engraved with four lines parallel to one another on the frontal plane and turned up on the sides. The edge of the mouth is smooth. The flews are not turned out. The lips are undercut to reveal the ridges of the gums and the teeth. Only the stumps remain of the upper and lower canines. The chin is narrower and shorter than the upper jaw. The extended position of the tongue (slightly asymmetrical to right) and the cavern of the deeply hollowed palate emphasize the lion\u0026rsquo;s ferocious expression. From the front, the head is oval, with the mane fitting tightly around the head; in profile, the head is long with the mane flowing from the edge of the face to the edge of the skull. The ruff is composed of a pattern of pinnate, plastically rendered hanks of hair on top; shorter triangular sections of the mane are carved in the interstices. On the sides and under the neck, the mane is more schematically rendered and the forms flatter. The soft folded-over ears emerge from the mane (the right one is more legible than the left).\nThe left side of the head is indented along a broad, shallow groove, making the head slightly asymmetrical, and gives evidence of the original shape of the amber blank from which the object was carved. The pendant was perforated with two 2 mm holes, each initiated on the sides of the finial (collar?) and exiting caudally through the base. The finial consists of a 3 mm flute flanked on each side by raised fillets. When suspended, the head would have hung downward with the top of head showing.\nDiscussion The signs of use wear of 76.AO.80 are significant. The pulling troughs on the upper edges of the perforation demonstrate longtime use where gravity or human activity has caused the suspension cord to saw the amber. This is the only animal head in the Getty collection to demonstrate this use; the other ambers in the collection with visible wear by abrasion are female head-pendants. Unlike on the female head-pendants, however, there is little corresponding wear on the face. There is no internal evidence to suggest the manner of the pendant\u0026rsquo;s use, whether as personal adornment (and whether it was talismanically rubbed or kissed) or as an ornament suspended from a branch, animal harness, or architectural element.\nCounterparts for 76.AO.80 were found in female graves in controlled excavations, and it is possible that this piece came from a similar context. While representations of both ram\u0026rsquo;s head–wearing women and men are documented in funerary imagery, there is no comparable image of a lion\u0026rsquo;s head wearer of either sex. Whatever may have been the pre-interment function of the amber, gold, and bronze lions\u0026rsquo; heads, their ultimate role was funerary, just like the necklaces with lions\u0026rsquo; heads hanging from the branches in the grove of the Etrusco-Ionian Tomb of Hunting and Fishing.\n","id":59,"length":724,"title":"Pendant","type":"entry","url":"https://gettypubs.github.io/ambers/objects/33/"},{"content":" Provenance 1976, Gordon McLendon (Dallas, TX), donated to the J. Paul Getty Museum, 1976.\nCondition The object is intact, in very good condition, with minimal cracking and crazing overall. There are minute chips in the mane on the right side and behind the right eye, and more degraded small areas on the lower right side of the head, marked by a lighter yellow-ocher alteration area. In ambient light, the object is dull brown; illuminated by transmitted light, it is ruby colored. No inclusions are evident.\nDescription This amber is worked in the shape of the head and neck of a ferocious lion. The head is almost perfectly square. In frontal view, the object is tubular. In profile, the face tapers toward the nose and chin. The supraorbital areas are plastically modeled, with fine ridges carved to represent the eyelids. The eye sockets are deep, hollow, and asymmetrical: the right one is higher and more circular than the left one, which is amygdaloidal in form. The sockets may originally have held inlaid eyes (ivory and amber?).\nThe snout slopes down to a step above the short, rounded nose. The nares and nostrils are detailed with fine horizontal grooves. Two additional horizontal engraved lines, wrinkles, cross the bridge of the snout just above the nose. Four engraved diagonal lines rise from each side of the upper lip, wrinkling the lion\u0026rsquo;s muzzle. The philtrum is indented. The mouth of the lion is a large, hollow cavity. The lips are drawn back tightly and undercut to reveal the gums; a full set of incisors and matched small teeth rim the mouth. Below are flaps of the jaw marked with two incised lines on each side at the front. The end of the tongue protrudes and is slightly transluscent.\nThe back of the head, which is beveled, is larger in circumference than the mane. The mane is a raised collar. On the upper part of the head, the hanks of hair are rendered as long pinnate lobes with shorter triangular fillers. On the underside, the mane is not detailed. The lion\u0026rsquo;s large ears commence at the back of the mane, lying flat to the head and pointing straight backward.\nThere are many tool marks. Incision lines mark the wrinkles of the muzzle, the nose, and the details of the mouth. Abrasion is evident on the back of the head and around the lower edge of the collar. Faint drill marks remain inside the bore.\nDiscussion The style (and form) of the lion of 76.AO.81 is not closely paralleled by any other lion\u0026rsquo;s head. However, an amber lion pendant in London (British Museum 64), of unknown provenance, bears a familial resemblance. Both look as if they would mew rather than roar. The similarities are most obvious in profile or top view. The rendering of both animals is schematic, and they seem tame. They have simplified ruffs, flat muzzles, and wooden mandibles, and the eyes are crudely modeled bulges.\nThere is one other figured amber with a through-bore, a stylized head of a ram in the Getty collection ( Citation: 82.AO.161.4Cat. no. 53, cat. no. 53). Both lions\u0026rsquo; and rams\u0026rsquo; heads may have served similar purposes. Perhaps they served as the tiny inset spouts of small vessels, as a decoration on a small container, or as the finial bead of a necklace or other item of adornment. The faïence feline-head amulets on an Eighteenth Dynasty string of beads in New York are one prototype for the latter.1 An Egyptian object in the Norbert Schimmel collection; a unique Egyptian blue (light) finial of a lion\u0026rsquo;s head holding in its open jaws a Negro head, provides another idea. If reconstructed on this model, the lion\u0026rsquo;s mouth may have held a human leg or head, part of an animal, or small prey. Greek models for such a use are the incorporated animal protome spouts on terracotta and metal vessels, the earliest dating to the seventh century. The lion\u0026rsquo;s-head spouts on three gold rhyta from the fourth–third century Panagyurishte Treasure (Bulgaria) are a later model for such a hypothetical use.2\nThe lions of 76.AO.81 and the London pendant (British Museum 64) fit in well with the group of Late Archaic–period Etruscan lions, small gold heads, and various objects of bronze brought together by W. L. Brown.3 As he showed, these lions show strong stylistic relationships to earlier Etruscan lions and Greek models, from both Ionia and Magna Graecia. The closest among them are the gold lions\u0026rsquo; heads and a bronze lion once on the Rome art market. They have a comparable form of the mane, of the lower face, including the semicircular flaps, and deepset eyes. A bronze head in Boston from Orvieto has a similar disposition of the teeth and lower jaw (including the lower flaps), and the lion\u0026rsquo;s head of a lacunaria in Perugia from Castel San Mariano has a remarkably similar profile and the same short face, set-in eyes, and small tongue.4 76.AO.81 is also effectively compared in type to the heads of the lions and chimeras on a group of Late Archaic Etruscan gold fibulae.\nThe distinctive physiognomic elements of the bronze comparisons place 76.AO.81 near to Perugia. The style of the pendant also shows a connection to Cerveteri and Vulci, the locations where the gold pendants are thought to have been made.\nWhether 76.AO.81 were an ornament finial or a tiny spout, the lion\u0026rsquo;s head would have played its traditional roles in protection and the aversion of danger. If liquid poured from its mouth, such a use would relate it to the popular lion\u0026rsquo;s-head waterspouts on sacred (and secular) buildings5 and to fountain heads.\nNotes   New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1926 26.7.1364.

Paul Getty Museum, 1977.\nCondition The lion\u0026rsquo;s head is intact and in excellent condition; the surface is smooth and firm. There are only a few small chips on the throat area and on the back of the mane. Pale yellow mottling covers much of the surface. Pale yellow-ocher patina (degraded amber) surrounds the eyes and lies in other crevices. The amber is dark brownish red in ambient light. In transmitted light, it is translucent and bright reddish orange. One long inclusion runs the length of the head.\nDescription In form and profile views, the narrowness and flatness of this head are striking. The height is proportionally low in comparison to its width and length. From the dorsal view, presumably the main view when the pendant was suspended, the impression of a compressed composition disappears. In fact, it reads very much like that of the head of Citation: 77.AO.81.10Cat. no. 36 (cat. no. 36), which is three-dimensional.\nFrom its general structure to the details of the eyes, mane, or chin the head is a combination of flattened and plastically modeled forms. Engraved lines mark the mouth, muzzle wrinkles, the circumscription of the eyes, eyebrows, and the fillet at the back. The slanted-back eyes, of an almost rectangular form, are deeply carved, leaving the eyeballs protruding above the cheek plane. The folded-over ears, of triangular shape with soft points, arise from the back of the mane. The snout is smooth and softly curved, stepping down to the tip of the nose, which tilts upward. The nose-to-chin line is even and tapers in slightly. The nostrils are drilled.\nThe muzzle itself is flat and wrinkled, with five folds of flesh that are rendered by uneven diagonal grooves radiating from the mouth rather than from the philtrum. Three ruffled bulges break the line of the mouth on the sides. The underside of the jaw and throat area is flat. The mane is schematically rendered as a smooth collar. At the back termination are two parallel grooved lines.\nPatterns of tiny scratches caused by abrasion are visible on the back of the piece. Two holes 1 mm in diameter are bored into the base, originating near the outer edge, sloping downward and inward toward the center. A pair of 1.5 mm-diameter perforations is drilled under the throat area: one bore originates below the right ear: a second begins below the left corner of the jaw. This latter perforation might have been secondary to those on the base. When attached to the base borings, the lion would have hung nose downward. If it had been suspended from the cross-bore through the head, it would have hung nose upward.\nDiscussion The pose of the head and neck encode a mixture of lion behaviors: repose is implied both by the closed mouth and by the relaxed eyes; the inclination of the head suggests motion; and the position of the ears, which lie flat against the head, signal a display of anger.\nAlthough related in style to the following head ( Citation: 77.AO.81.10Cat. no. 36), especially in dorsal view, it differs in small physiognomic details from other representations in amber and other media. Distinguishing features of this head are the flatness of the pendant, the flat collar of mane devoid of fur markings, the muzzle wrinkles, and the ruffled upper lip. According to W. L. Brown, the last might be considered a regressive trait in lion representation of the period.1 There appears to be no other example of an amber pendant perforated in this manner. The only parallel for such a system known to me is an Elamite lapis lazuli bull\u0026rsquo;s head from Susa.2 On that head, when the cross-bore in the head section is connected to the base set, the resulting holes make an anchored suspension loop.\nNotes   Citation: Brown 1960Brown, W.

On the reverse is an old loss and more recent breaks on the back of the neck and top of the head. On the obverse, the many fine cracks in the surface layers extend through the piece; there is a large crack through the left eye and left part of the head. There are no apparent inclusions. The surface is a dull matte yellow-brown to reddish brown on the old surfaces and a rich, glassy, brownish red-orange on the newly broken areas. With transmitted light, the amber is transparent and bright red-orange.\nDescription This pendant represents a calmly posed lion whose ears lie flat against its head. The neck portion is cylindrical. The modeling of the head is smooth. The forehead is gently rounded, the snout sloping to the down-curving, rounded nose. The eye sockets are bored fairly deeply, which suggests that they might have been inlaid. The muzzle is relatively large and full, divided longitudinally by a shallow indentation; no philtrum is indicated. Fine lines are engraved on the muzzle to indicate creases. Similar lines detail the ears, the closure of the mouth, and the slits of the nostrils. The chin is distinctly bulbous.\nRaised only slightly from the surface of the head, the collar of mane is carved with an undulating edge to suggest the texture of the ruff. There are finely engraved lines suggesting the hairs of the mane. Large ears, with the helixes flopped over, point downward (or backward?), and commence at the back of the ruff.\nThe very slight asymmetry of the piece (the lion\u0026rsquo;s head cants slightly to its left) might indicate something of the original shape of the amber piece. There is a perforation, 2 mm in diameter, for suspension that passes laterally through the pendant about 2 mm from the surface of the base. It appears that a piece of the base was broken off in antiquity, leaving exposed a transverse section through the suspension perforation. The pendant would have hung nose downward.\nDiscussion Within the corpus of lions\u0026rsquo; heads, this example stands out. It has no close parallel in amber or any other material. Although the face exudes serenity, the representation also includes more aspects of lion behavior. The flattened ears are an attitude usually associated with roaring, leaping, and anger or fear.\nThe artistic style of this cat reveals its breeding: its artistic-morphological characteristics depend on earlier traditions of lion representation. The softness of modeling is reminiscent of East Greek carving, as a comparison to some Lydian felines makes clear.1 Ultimately, the pointed, folded ear laid back in anger on the head is borrowed from Assyria. The narrow back of ruff has mainland Greek and Magna Graecian parallels; and the lack of a back mane is common in Italian creations.2\n77.AO.81.10 is comparable to a series of Etruscan bronze objects dated by W. L. Brown to the Late Archaic period, comparisons that locate this head to north-central Etruria. Other bronzes might situate this amber pendant more precisely, to the early fifth century, and to Orvieto specifically. Among these comparanda are a hammered bronze finial of a chariot pole, from near Orvieto, now in Boston3 (dated by M. Comstock and C. Vermeule to the early fifth century), and, from the same find, the four couchant lions of a wheeled brazier.4\nThe stepped taper of the pendant\u0026rsquo;s base might be evidence that the head was set into a metal mount. This head then could have served as a finial on a bracelet or as a pendant in a necklace.\nNotes   It might also be compared to any number of Egyptian New Kingdom images of lioness divinities.

Paul Getty Museum, 1977.\nCondition The pendant is in good condition, although it has suffered some surface degradation and losses. The surface is grainy, with cracks and crazing overall. The tip of the snout, a section of the right orbital area, and the tips of the hooves, especially on the right, are missing. There are small chips on the tips of both ears, the right side of the mandible, and the underside of the left leg. Except at the new breaks, the piece is opaque, the surface brownish tan with a pale yellow patina; in transmitted light, the reddish brown translucency of the inner structure is visible at the breaks. There are no visible inclusions.\nDescription The pendant is carved fully in the round, including the head, forelegs, and upper trunk of a wild boar. The body is truncated about midway, at a point immediately behind the caudal end of the mane. The animal is in the pheonotype of repose, with its forelegs drawn up under its head. In side view, the narrow body portion of the pendant is rectangular and the head long and triangular. In frontal view, it is somewhat flat.\nThe anatomy of the boar is sleekly modeled, with the details of musculature revealed by subtle surface modulations in the region between the shoulder and the base of the skull. The surviving eye cavity is shallow and unfinished at the bottom edge. The lip is sharply upturned where it meets the protruding tusks and teeth; the teeth must have numbered three on each side, although none remains on the damaged side. The sensitively carved leaf-shaped ears lie close to the head and point straight back. Incised marks representing bristles mark the jowls. The ridge of mane is smooth and rounded and projects only slightly above the backbone; it is incised with fine diagonal striations that point outward. The shoulder is minimized in comparison to the head and plump forelegs.\nThe narrowness of the animal in frontal view suggests that the artist was constrained by the thinness of the original amber blank from which this piece was worked. When suspended, the animal would have been seen in profile and hung head downward.\nDiscussion There exist a number of boar-subject amber objects, but no close parallel for this pendant. The boar is an uncommon subject in pre-Roman amber and an infrequent subject generally in Greek and Etruscan jewelry; it is far more common in other media, as a figurative subject on arms and armor or ceramic vases or stamped in coinage. Except for Citation: 77.AO.83Cat. no. 38 (cat. no. 38) and a fragmentary plaque in New York,1 the other wild-boar subjects in amber are pendants or the decorative bows of fibulae. In addition to this example, there are three other pendants in the form of boars, all in the recumbent position: a pendant in New York, a more schematic example in London (British Museum 77), and a softer type, one of the numerous pendants from Tomb 102 at Braida di Vaglio.2 The boars-as-bows of fibulae are standing: an example in Cleveland arches its back (the animal is similar in form and style to 76.AO.84);3 the fibula bow in a London private collection4 is stiff and simplified in modeling and unrelated to any other Greek or Etruscan representation. Also probably meant to represent a recumbent boar is a small amber in London (BM 76), titled by Donald Strong “pendant in the form of the foreparts of a pig.”5\nIn style, these wild boars invite comparison with contemporary Archaic representations in other media—small bronzes, coins, gems, and paintings on vases. The boars of 76.AO.84, Citation: 77.AO.83Cat. no. 38, the New York plaque, and the Cleveland fibula bow decoration compare especially well with the boar represented on an amygdaloidal serpentine gem in Berlin, which has been connected to Melos.6 The ambers and the gem share common forms of eyes, ears, whiskers, and mane, to cite but four key traits. They also share many sculptural similarities with a number of small sculpted bronze boars: a winged boar at bay in the Norbert Schimmel collection;7 a close parallel in the Hispanic Society, New York;8 a relative of theirs, although later and without wings, in the Walters Museum in Baltimore;9 and two early-fifth-century bronzes, a Campanian (possibly) wild boar at bay from a large, circular vessel in Boston;10 and a standing boar, one of the Etruscan votive bronzes from the votive deposit of Fonte Veneziana, Arezzo.11 The two winged boars in New York present both dating and location problems, as Hans Hoffman outlined. The stylistic conventions for (the few extant) sculpted boars are virtually identical with the boars painted on Early and Middle Corinthian pottery. The absence of a break in the bronze boars\u0026rsquo; manes, their taut modeling, and rich use of incision argues against an Ionian origin for the bronzes. Hoffman concluded that the two are Greek and to be dated to the second half of the sixth century, a general attribution and date appropriate also for 76.AO.84.\n76.AO.84 may have come from the same original context as the kore ( Citation: 76.AO.77Cat. no. 8, cat. no. 8) and three of the rams\u0026rsquo;-head pendants in the Getty collection: Citation: 76.AO.82Cat. no. 39 (cat. no. 39), Citation: 76.AO.83Cat. no. 40 (cat. no. 40), and Citation: 77.AO.81.7Cat. no. 41 (cat. no. 41). This is plausible because of the similar condition and the similar style of the five carvings. It is suggested in the entry for the kore that it is a work of a South Ionian artisan. The resemblance of 76.AO.84 to the Melian-attributed Greek serpentine gemstone might support an East Greek connection. Further comparisons with early East Greek coinage of the late sixth to mid-fifth century B.C. with boar devices, such as that of Clazomenae and Samos, should bear fruitful results.\nThe wild boar plays an important role in European myth, for it was perhaps the most ferocious wild animal in Europe, once lions were extinct. In Greek myth, Peleus was chased up a tree by a lion and a boar; Atys, son of Croisus, Attis, and Adonis were slain by boars. Ultimately, it is the boar sent by Artemis (furious that King Oeneus of Calydonia had forgotten to include the goddess in his annual sacrifices to the gods) that led to the death of Meleager.\nAs a symbol, device, or amulet the boar could work amuletically by assimilation: the wearer, object, or building would take on the characteristics of the animal. In direct magic, a boar could frighten off danger and by extension was protective. The boar is a common blazon on Archaic armor; it might be woven into the decoration of a divine robe or mounted as protection on a building. Boar waterspouts on the corner of a sima might play an even more important role than lions\u0026rsquo; heads flanking the sides of a temple.\nAlthough many ancient representations of the foreparts of an active boar exist, including winged boars—on gems, on coins, and as the blazons of shields painted on Archaic-period Greek vases—much rarer is the recumbent boar, whether complete or excerpted, as in the case of the foreparts. In general, a recumbent animal is a tamed or sleeping animal, not an active one, and this may be key to its magical function. The 76.AO.84 boar may be latently powerful; it rests in readiness, its aggressiveness to be called upon when needed to viciously protect its charge and attack danger.\nNotes   Fragmentary boar plaque: Metropolitan Museum of Art 1992.11.17, Purchase, Renée and Robert A.

Paul Getty Museum, 1977.\nCondition Before its entry into the museum, the piece was broken into five pieces and repaired. The breaks, along or through four of the five vertical perforations, were filled with a tan resinlike material, creating a banded appearance. The surface is stable, its upper surface layers mottled yellow-brown, with sporadic pitting, small chips at the edges of the breaks, and fine cracks overall. Yellow residue of degraded amber appears in cracks around the outline of the boar and behind the lions\u0026rsquo; heads, around the lions\u0026rsquo; eyes, and in their mouths and manes. After it arrived at the museum, the object was treated with amber oil distillate that probably darkened its color. The background area is more matte in appearance than the (shinier) boar. The piece is darkish tan to brownish red in ambient light and is a dark ruby-red in transmitted light. There are no visible inclusions.\nDescription In the central obverse panel of the flat, rectangular piece, a left-facing boar is carved in shallow relief (on the reverse, the central area is plain). The boar fills the panel, its forelegs extended widely, with its right foreleg back and its left forward. The rear legs are closer to each other, with the right hind leg at the back and the left hind leg forward.\nThe boar\u0026rsquo;s heavy head is in the relaxed position that is associated with walking; its chin is on the same level as its abdomen. The top of the head dishes in slightly above the snout, which is long and pointed. The large, squarish almond-shaped eye is set low in the face and is framed above by a heavy bulge. Only the lower part of the ear remains, the top obscured by one of the repairs.\nThe ridge of bristles extends from the forehead and appears to continue all the way to the lower back. Swellings at the shoulder and above the elbow suggest the animal\u0026rsquo;s powerful musculature. The full-tipped tail hangs down behind the animal\u0026rsquo;s hocks.\nThe heads of two open-mouthed lions, facing outward, flank the boar. While the four lions\u0026rsquo; heads are similar, they are not identical. The two obverse profiles are more carefully detailed than are those on the reverse. The head composed of the obverse right and reverse left is larger and more fully modeled; the ruff is more plastically rendered, and it has fully defined ears on both sides. The head composed of the obverse left and reverse right is smaller and more sketchily treated, and its volumes are simplified.\nDespite all this, the two lions\u0026rsquo; heads may be considered typologically to be of one style. The face is short and the muzzle is flat and slightly inclined. A bulge above the protrusion of the eye and the depression of the cheek below the eye socket are rendered naturalistically. The snout continues the incline of the head, but the nose tilts up very slightly at the tip. The muzzle is divided by an indented philtrum, and the folds are separated by four wrinkles. The lips are drawn back, revealing a set of small teeth, both sets of canines, and the gum ridges. The tongue is outstretched. The lower lip is boldly scalloped, and the chin is short and globular. A sharp indentation sets off the angle of the mane from the jaw. The collar of mane is wider at the top, tapering, and curving inward at the neck. The individual hanks of hair, formed into unevenly shaped triangles, are set off from the face by shallow indentations but still give the impression of growing from the head; at the back, they are squared off. On the edges are the compacted frontal faces of the lions.\nEngraved tooling lines are found on the lions\u0026rsquo; manes, teeth, eyes, noses, nostrils, and muzzle wrinkles. Such marks are also found on the boar\u0026rsquo;s back and above its hooves. Linear abrasions (which appear to be file marks) are seen on the lions\u0026rsquo; jaw flaps and manes, and scraping or abrasion marks appear around the contour of the boar.\nThe piece is perforated vertically with five holes. Each hole was drilled from top and bottom: the holes meet midway. From left to right: set a (above lion\u0026rsquo;s ear): 2 mm, top and bottom; set b (behind boar\u0026rsquo;s ear): 2 mm top, 2.3 mm bottom; set c (at boar\u0026rsquo;s mid-body): 2 mm top, 1.75 mm bottom; set d (at rear termination of boar\u0026rsquo;s bristles): 2 mm top, 1.8 mm bottom; set e (behind lion\u0026rsquo;s mane): 2 mm top and bottom. Neither the top nor the bottom edges of the piece are truly flat. The upper edge of the pendant is slightly convex, while the lower has soft, concave undulations.\nDiscussion There is no parallel for this plaque in amber or in any other material. It is one of three pre-Roman-period examples of figured amber plaques with low relief carving. Two others are the Getty Addorsed Sphinxes ( Citation: 78.AO.286.2Cat. no. 28, cat. no. 28) and a hemispherical plaque with a recumbent boar in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.1 The plaque is very like ivory carving and can be compared to a wide number of Etruscan ivory and bone plaques.2 In the modeling of the figures and the depth of the carving, the plaque looks back to the ninth-century ivory plaques, from Assyria and north Syria especially, made for insertion into furniture.\nThe lions of 77.AO.83 are generally comparable to a number of Etruscan lions of the Late Archaic, a large and varied group gathered together by W. L. Brown, with the closest parallels dating to the fifth century.3 In style and scale, the plaque finials are related to two small, possibly Campanian bronzes found at sites on the mid-Adriatic: a lion in Boston (from the marshes of Sirolo)4 was once the rim or shoulder decoration of a lebes, or another large, circular vessel, and a lion from a dinos rim from Amendolara (in Ancona).5 The bronzes and amber lions\u0026rsquo; heads have in common facial shape and modeling, especially around the eyes, and have similarly scalloped flews, angular breaks at the jaws and mane, and flamelike locks.\nFrom the same vessel as the Boston lion is a boar at bay. It is related in type and style to the boar of 77.AO.83, as is the bronze boar votive from the extra-urban deposit of Fonte Veneziana, Arezzo, in Florence.6 Each is sculpted with a sympathetic simplification of the features and softness and subtlety in the modeling. The boar of the amber plaque and the two bronze boars are the slim creatures of the sixth century, not the heavier-set creatures of fifth-century Greek gemstones.\nThe boar and the lions of 77.AO.83 are tame beasts. The boar gives little indication of its legendary strength or its viciousness when at bay; instead, the most dangerous beast to roam the ancient countryside and the fiercest adversary of the most skilled hunter trots meekly to stage left. The lions of 77.AO.83 make the motion of roaring but instead only drop their nutcrackerlike jaws, tamely opening their mouths.\nBased on the form of the amber plaque, the horizontal orientation of the subjects, and the five large vertical perforations of equal size and placement that transverse it, it might be supposed that the plaque was part of a complex object. Strands must have run through the piece, with those above connecting to another section, necklace, or to a fibula. Those below may have attached another section, or perhaps terminated in small pendants. Alternatively, the plaque may have been the main portion of a comb. If the body of a comb, it may have resembled the earlier ivory comb with sphinxes from the Tomb of Ivories, Marsiliana d\u0026rsquo;Albegna.7\nWhy the combination of boars\u0026rsquo; and lions\u0026rsquo; heads on an amber plaque? In northern Europe, in the Greek-speaking world, and in Italy, but not in Egypt, the boar was an especially important subject, in particular for protective purposes.8 It is common as a device on armor and figures as the subject of waterspouts (but only on the corners of simas). Lions could serve as protective and danger-averting symbols and represented the sun and regeneration. The boar was the most ferocious animal in the pantheon of the hunt. The most famous boars recounted in Greek tales were the ravaging boars of the countryside, best known from the important hunts organized to destroy them, which include Herakles\u0026rsquo; killing of the Erymanthean boar and the hunt for the Calydonian boar. And as Ivan Mazarov notes,\n Like the wild youth, the boar is a largely undifferentiated creature: it is both herbivorous and predatory, and although it lives on land, it prefers marshes and swamps. Since ancient times, the boar has been a recurring metaphor for the ferocious warrior. It has also signified death.… The boar could test the hero\u0026rsquo;s virtue. If he won, the powers of the defeated antagonist passed on to him. In Thrace, the principal adversary of a pretender to the Thracian kingship was the wild boar. 9\n The imagery of this amber plaque might have been suitable for both male and female owners. If it were found in a woman or child\u0026rsquo;s tomb, the association of the boar in the feminine realm is of importance. The pendant may refer to Artemis in her aspect as Agrotera (or to the Etruscan Artumes). As goddess of the hunt, the divinity roamed mountain forests and uncultivated land hunting for wild animals, including especially lions but also panthers, hinds, stags, hares, and boars. As a wild and fierce animal, the boar was regarded as a symbol of one side of the goddess\u0026rsquo;s nature, capable of unleashing sudden, violent destruction on humans and property, and her sacred buildings were often decorated with images of boars\u0026rsquo; heads.10\nThe joining of lion and walking boar on 77.AO.83 is significant. The two animals are featured in combat or paired in calmer modes throughout ancient art. The subjects are common shield devices in Greek and Etruscan art, both individually and in combat. The two animals are also linked in one of the early stories of Greek myth: Adrastus, king of Argos, had learned from an oracle that he must yoke his daughters to a boar and a lion. He then saw Polynices and Tydeus, an exile from Calydon, fighting. One of them had a boar painted on his shield, the other a lion. Adrastus immediately recognized the true meaning of the oracle, stopped the fight, and married his daughters to the combatants. In the Iliad, the combat of two great warriors is likened to a boar and a lion.11 Artemis, alternatively, may be key to this representation in amber. She is associated with both wild animals, and was protector of women and girls, likely the recipient of this amber. The significance of the use of boars and the pairing of boars with other animals of the hunt might have been the most powerful kind of “fighting fire with fire” imagery.\nNotes   Metropolitan Museum of Art 1992.11.17, Purchase, Renée and Robert A.

Rams’ heads are among the most numerous of pre-Roman amber subjects and range considerably in style.1 The earliest ones can be dated to the third quarter of the sixth century B.C., but the first documented examples date to the last decade of the sixth. There are a number from fifth-century contexts and a group from the fourth century. Some, such as Citation: 76.AO.82Cat. no. 39 (cat. no. 39), are minor masterpieces of Archaic art, while others are vaguely blocked out and defined with schematic scratchings. The differences among the rams’ heads throughout the period of their production suggest that they were made by any number of carvers, some highly skilled, others not, for acquirers from all parts of the Italian peninsula and areas within close sailing distance. The findspots include central and south Italy, two sites in ancient Illyria, and Alalia (Corsica). Many others that can be dated by style to the sixth and fifth centuries have come to light without secure documentation. Of the examples in the Getty collection, three are dated here by style to the sixth century, and ten examples to the fifth.\nAmber rams’ heads are usually found in pairs or larger numbers, along with other amber objects, figured and plain pendants, beads, and fibulae. In the sixth century, rams’ heads were the most numerous of all figured subjects in amber. They were joined with korai, female head-pendants, birds, heads of lions, boars, gazelles, and horses, and floral and shell subjects. Ram subjects in amber are not documented in the company of human or humanoid male subjects, satyrs, Dionysos, Herakles, or any of the other unnamed bearded or unbearded males represented in amber. Rare, too, is the interment of ram subjects with demonic subjects. Two exceptions are the rams’ heads from Tomb 102 at Braida di Vaglio, which included a sphinx, and the rams’ heads in the Petit Palais, Paris, from the Sala Consilina burial, which included a range of flying figures, perhaps harpies or sirens.2\nThe parallels for the amber heads in other media have led to the conclusion that the earliest amber rams’ heads were made in the second half of the sixth century, in an ambient where Greek specialists (Laconian, Ionians, Islanders, and other Eastern Greeks) were working, but the locations are elusive. Comparanda for the sixth-century amber rams’ heads range from the rams on the handles of Greek bronze vessels, especially Laconian ware, and on other kinds of Greek bronzes, statuettes, mirrors, and other utensils; the sheep subjects engraved on Ionian Greek gems; a singular silver ram pendant in New York; the pairs of rams on a silver East Greek oinochoe found in Lydia; and the rams’ heads struck on coinage from Cyzicus, Cyprus, Lesbos, Delphi, and Melos.3 Plastic vases in the form of recumbent rams and ram protomes, the small plastic ram protomes on Greek and Etruscan ceramics, and the drawings of rams on black- and red-figured vases of various fabrics also provide a mine of further comparanda.\nMost of the amber rams’ heads appear to date to the fifth century. Parallels include gold works dated by specialists to the late sixth century, but which may be later. These include a Greek gold ram’s-head pendant from Eretria in Berlin, and a gold fibula with the tip in the form of a ram’s head from Ruvo in London.4 The amber rams’ heads dated to the second half of the fifth century have several good comparisons in precious metals, among them a gold necklace with nine rams’ heads excavated from a tomb of circa 450–425 at Roccanova and the spiral earrings ornamented with rams’ heads worn by the nymph Arethusa on Syracusan tetradrachms of 405 B.C.5\nThe best evidence for early-fourth-century amber rams’ heads comes from a sporadic find at Cumae and three graves from the Andriuolo necropolis at Paestum, the latter datable to circa 380–370 B.C.6 In each case, rams’ heads were all part of necklaces that also included female heads. Both types are schematic.\nAn important antecedent for the joining of rams’ heads and other figured elements in jewelry is the “Island Greek” or Lydian (perhaps) crescent-shaped gold pendant from Aydin (Tralles) of about 600 B.C.7 In addition to rams’ heads, this pectoral pendant includes the figure of Potnia Theron with snakes, rosettes, and sun disks, and griffins’, lions’, and bulls’ heads. Potnia Theron is the divinity who oversees plant life, the creatures and demons of the earth, the chthonic realm, and the sky. The Aydin pendant thus might be read as the ontological statement of a divinity of great fecundity and protectiveness. Despite the difference in scale, the role of the ram here is similar to that of the ram protomes of the large stone perirrhanterion, the ritual purification basin from the Isthmian sanctuary of Poseidon: the bowl is held up by women standing on lions, holding them by leash and tail, interspersed with large rams’ heads.8 A ritual object such as the seventh-century terracotta lamp from a Gela sanctuary (the rams alternate with female protomes) may be an excerpt of such an ontological declaration.9\nRams’ heads are also a popular subject of “Phoenician” glass pendants10 and the subject of one uncommon type of Egyptian scaraboid, a blue frit amulet of the earlier sixth century made at Naukratis.11 The blue frit scaraboids are unusual in their treatment as seals with representational motifs or inscriptions on the flat sides. Their distribution is significant: Greece, the Black Sea, Magna Graecia (Taranto), and one example from Cerveteri.12 Related Egyptian amulet types, representing the king of the gods, Amen-Re, are the flat-backed amulets of a ram’s head with a disk and uraeus, or uraeus alone, in hollow gold and lapis lazuli as well as glazed-composition and frit, a feature of burials from the Third Intermediate period onward.13 Such is the role of the rams’ heads flanking the neck on the pair of glazed-composition flasks found in the “Isis Tomb” at the Polledrara cemetery at Vulci (British Museum GR 1850.2-27.57): the pair of rams’ heads invoke Amen, and the hieroglyphic inscription expresses greetings for the New Year, a potentially dangerous time of transition, just as was death.\nArchaic representations of ram’s-head pendants in use include sculpted and painted examples, worn by both females and males, both deities and mortals. Some examples are telling: the terracotta statuette of an enthroned chthonic(?) female deity from Agrigento wears three superimposed pectoral strings with bull, ram, and satyr heads.14 The subject of a terracotta urn lid (from the Monte Abatone necropolis, Cerveteri) is a reclining woman, who wears a necklace with seven pendants, two of them rams’ heads.15 The male banqueter painted in the pediment of the main wall of the Tomb of Hunting and Fishing at Tarquinia wears three ram pendants on a carrier. In addition, several necklaces (one with three lions’ heads) hang from branches in the grove of the first chamber of the same tomb.16 The rams’ heads (amber) worn by the Monte Abatone figure are painted reddish in color, the same color of the two tiny beads at the top of the necklace, in contrast with the yellow-orange (perhaps gold) central pendants. The three rams’ heads worn by the male banqueter in the Tomb of Hunting and Fishing are the same reddish color as his skin and contrast in color with the yellow and white limned vessels (perhaps of shiny bronze or silver) held by the participants. The ram’s-head necklace in the first chamber is also painted a reddish color, in contrast with the yellow-orange palmette and lion pendants (also gold, perhaps) in the murals of the first chamber.17\nErika Simon interpreted the trees of the first chamber of the Tomb of Hunting and Fishing as a sacred grove of Apollo (and the trees as laurels) as further evidence supporting her larger argument concerning the importance of Apollo in the funerary art and customs of Etruria (in contrast to his Greek nature).18 If, indeed, the grove is Apollo’s and the animal head necklaces hanging from the trees are of amber, this could be taken as further evidence of the connection between amber, Apollo, and life in the tomb as well as the funereal realm. Although the rams’ heads depicted in southern Etruria predate by several decades the Delphic coin types with confronted pairs of mounted rams’ heads (perhaps pendants rather than rhyta), the coins may substantiate the Apollonian connection.19 Alternatively, it is possible that the tomb is Dionysian, as Sybille Haynes argues.20 Stephan Steingräber points out its Dionysian aspects.21 The ram has always enjoyed favor as a potent symbol because of the animal’s legendary strength and virility (and hence its creative powers), and its characteristics as a leader and protector of his flock. In the ancient Near East, and from earliest times throughout the Mediterranean, the ram was associated with powerful divinities and heroic figures, wealth and the elite, and sacrifice. In south Italy, ivory figurines of recumbent animals, including the ram (decorations of fibulae, for the most part), were excavated at Motte delle Timpone (Francavilla Marittima).22 At Argos and Perachora in Greece, ivory ram figurines have appeared in sanctuaries devoted to Hera (Argos and Perachora) and at Ephesus in that of Artemis. The greatest number of ivory rams has come from the sanctuary of Ortheia (Artemis Orthia) at Sparta. In each case, the ram is linked with a powerful female divinity and a potent and high-value material. The series of early-sixth-century bronze Laconian hydriai (a shape that might be directly connected with women), with vertical handles animated by female heads, recumbent rams, and lions, could be other instances of this affiliation.23 The fourth-century necklaces with rams’ and female heads from Paestum, the last gasp of pre-Roman amber carving, may reflect the same pairing.\nThe traditional importance of the ram’s head as a subject in the ancient Near East is exemplified by two lapis lazuli pendants dating to the third millennium, possibly from Iran, and by a calcite Jemdet Nasr period amulet-seal of circa 3000 B.C.24 In Egypt, the ram was connected to several key deities.25 The ram with downturned horns was a symbol of the god Amun, and when he wore the solar disk between his horns or incorporated other solar iconography, the ram’s head was one of two guises of Amun Ra (the other was a goose). A ram’s head in amber, the subject enhanced and focused by the material from which the amulet was made, would put its wearer under the protection of the deity represented, who would by assimilation gain access to its particular powers.26\nThe ram, the most highly valued and sexually potent of domestic animals, was from earliest times the most prestigious sacrificial victim. Greek drinking vessels (rhyta) in the form of rams’ heads are the most numerous by far and had an ancient ancestry. In Greece, the ram’s-head rhyton, as first argued Hans Hoffman, is associated with tragic heroes (he who must die, i.e., be sacrificed himself).27\nA ram’s head might have been worn to show the patronage of, or devotion to, a deity. For a Greek or an Etruscan, a ram’s-head pendant may have been an exotic, “Oriental” magical amulet, a talisman of protection, one that symbolized the power or knowledge of Egypt, the Punic world, or the Near East.\nIn the Greek-speaking world, the most famous stories of the ram’s apotropaic powers concern acts by Hermes, the Olympian responsible for the increase and protection of flocks. At Tanagra, Hermes averted a pestilence from the city by carrying a ram around its walls. A series of ram-bearer statuettes found at Medma (Calabria) attest to the widespread influence of the cult of Hermes in the West.28 It was Hermes, too, who sent the golden ram that flew Phrixos to safety in Colchis. The magic of the volant ram did not cease at its sacrifice: the Golden Fleece displayed in the grove of Ares was believed to be magical. Throughout Greek culture, the ram figures prominently as a metaphor of strength and courage (thus the association with Ares). Accordingly, Homeric heroes are likened to thick-fleeced lambs (Iliad 3.197). In Attic vase painting, rams are sometimes represented in an explicitly sacrificial context. More commonly, the context is heroic, with the ram’s sacrificial role implicit only. Such is the case in the story of Phrixos, or of Odysseus. Both the ram that carried Odysseus from the Cyclops’s cave (Odyssey 9.436ff.) and Phrixos’s mount are sacrificed as soon as they have finished their tasks. Their sacrifice is part of the story. The emblematic power of the Golden Fleece recalls the story of Atreus and Thyestes: the kingdom belonged to him who owned the golden lamb.\nAlmost all of the small-scale individual rams’ heads have been found in graves or, in the case of their representation in art, in funerary settings. This is critical to a better understanding of the subject in adornment. Although ram’s-head adornments might be hung from trees in a painting, and worn by both male and female reclining figures, the amber heads from documented contexts have come exclusively from female tombs. It is likely that in each burial, the rams’ heads functioned as ornament and amulet, the subject and material combining to create an elite object, a potent ornament, one with a battery of allusions—religious, divine, heroic, mythic, magical. It may also have worked in aggressive magic or medicine. Many Late Antique gems are engraved with a ram-headed god, one wearing the symbol of the sun (based on Amun Ra) and are specifically connected with the uterus. Such amulets were thought to check any morbid condition, to prevent conception, or to favor and facilitate parturition.29\nThe solar aspects of amber may well have underscored the connection of the pendant subjects with regeneration, with the Egyptian ba, with solar divinities, with heroes (Odysseus, Phrixos, or Jason), or with a magical figure such as Medea. The Aydin (Tralles) pendant suggests the place of the ram in the universe of a powerful female nature divinity. Of the Olympian gods, if Apollo (the solar divinity) were brought to mind (and to work) by the ram’s head, then perhaps there was an association with his son Phaeton and the Heliades—whose shining tears shed in mourning for their brother Phaeton were hardened by the sun and turned into amber. If Hermes was evoked, it might not only allude to his legendary magical act at Tanagra, but his role—and the ram’s—as psychopompos. As this survey reflects, the subject of ram imagery in ancient art deserves continued study.30\nNotes   Recumbent and couchant rams of amber are much rarer than rams’ heads. This author knows of only one complete ram from a controlled excavation dating to the fifth century: a necklace with eighty-four plain beads and a ram pendant from Tomb 21, a collective grave in the cemetery of Valle Oscura (Marianopoli) of circa 530–470 (Marianopoli, Museo Archeologico 925): R.

The type is first found in the seventh century, in a small, not very carefully executed version, and survives down to the first century. The later examples are larger and are rendered more naturalistically. The heads are of white or dark glass, the horns in the opposite color. The animal’s eyes, ears, and horns are various colors. The various kinds of “Phoenician” glass pendants (bearded male heads, demonic heads, rams’ heads, birds, bells, grape bunches, and phalloi) were made the centerpieces of precious metal necklaces throughout the Mediterranean. The few examples from controlled excavations in Italy have come from graves. The rams are attributed to Carthaginian workshops. See Citation: Uberti 1988Uberti, M.

The surface is sound, but there is considerable crazing and many areas where small flakes have chipped off. The caudal edge at the base plate has been rabbeted, most likely to fit into a now-missing metal mount. Part of the back has been broken off, revealing two plugged bores embedded with the remains of metal (silver?) wire or pins. Traces of metal corrosion product surround the attachments. The surface is red-orange, and under strong light, the core of the amber appears transparent and bright red-orange. No inclusions are evident. There are some tiny patches of yellowish residue on the surface.\nDescription The ram is extraordinary for its morphological specificity. The zygomatic process arches upward in a dramatic, swelling curve, and the eye sockets are deeply drilled. It is possible that inlaid eyes were originally inserted in these cavities. At the inner corner of the eye, three lines indicate folds of flesh below the eye. The ears are sharply raised from the surface of the horn. Five lines are incised across the lower nose and slope down toward the mouth. The nostrils are carved in shallow relief.\nFinely spaced diagonal cross-hatching defines the fleece on both poll and cheeks. The horns are relieved from the cap of fleece. Regular, evenly spaced ridges are incised for two-thirds of the length of the horn; three more lines are indicated at the midpoint of the remaining third; and one last ring circles the tip of the horn. The horn tips splay away from the face. The pattern of ridges is meticulously rendered, with a gentle undulation in the line; the spacing between the ridges narrows from the base toward the tip.\nThe anatomical detail of this pendant combined with the interplay in the surface pattern and the precision in artisanship mark this as the work of a master artisan. The counterpoint created by the placement of the curved, striated pattern of the ridges of the horns adjacent to the reticulated cross-hatching of the fleece offers but one example of the maker\u0026rsquo;s careful attention to detail.\nUnpolished tool marks lie deep in the curve of the horns; this was perhaps done to create shading. In other areas that would have been more difficult to finish, such as the sharp angle of intersection between the rings of the horns and the fleece, the tool marks are polished out.\nDiscussion This head of a ram may have come from the same original context as four other pendants in the Getty collection.

All have very similar hollowed-out eyes and show a similar use of the graver and of polishers. The kore pendant is attributed here to a South Ionian artisan, or to one trained with an artisan from the area, on the basis of comparison to terracottas and marbles. There is no such corresponding body of material for the other four pedants.\nThe three rams\u0026rsquo; heads are very much alike, and although generally similar to many other amber rams or rams\u0026rsquo; heads, they have no close counterparts. These three are comparable in the deep V-shape of the horns on the top of the head, the deep relief of the fleece from the neck, and the wavy, closely spaced ridges of the horns. The ridges of Citation: 76.AO.83Cat. no. 40 and Citation: 77.AO.81.7Cat. no. 41 have the same pattern of spacing.

A filament threaded through a perforation in the collar area suspended the ram\u0026rsquo;s head Citation: 76.AO.83Cat. no. 40. The decorative suspension device is very like that of the boar and kore pendants. The other two rams\u0026rsquo; heads, 76.AO.82 and Citation: 77.AO.81.7Cat. no. 41, must have been set into metal mounts for they both have broken bores that once held the metal pins (the breaks may have been caused by the expansion of metal corrosion products over the long period of the burial).

The amber is laced with fine, widely spaced cracks. An inclusion is visible at the throat. The amber is dark brown in ambient light, perhaps due to consolidation with amber oil. There is some yellow ocher degradation residue in the carved interstices. In transmitted light, the pendant appears dark red. Some transparency is noted in the areas of modern chips. A 2 mm horizontal perforation for suspension runs through the collar area of the back, about 1 mm below the surface. Probable metallic residue remains in the stopped bore on the proper right side of the head.\nDescription The head is finely rendered. Incised wavy ridges begin at the forehead and extend to the intersection with the tip of the ear; the remaining involution of the horn is smooth. The tips of the horn flare outward. The eyelid is distinct, with a sharp outer edge and deeply bored sockets. The cap of fleece on the poll rises above the plane of the face; the separation is delineated by a lateral incision. Shallow cross-hatching indicates the fleece on the poll and over the neck area. The depression of the throat is indicated by a faintly incised triangle under the mandible. The upper lip overhangs the lower lip, and the chin is rendered distinctly. The nostrils are incised.

Each upper eyelid has small chip losses. A section of the suspension device on the right side was broken off and reglued before entry into the Getty Museum. There is some loss associated with this area. The surface was apparently treated with a consolidant, such as amber oil. The surface has ocher-colored degradation material in interstices and particularly on the throat. The amber is a dull red-brown except for the shiny areas of the exposed fractured inner surface, which show the material\u0026rsquo;s transparency. In transmitted light, the pendant is dark red. The only visible inclusion is in the fissure that rises to the surface at the back.\nDescription The pendant is almost tubular. The horns do not rise higher than the poll, and they curve out timidly. The muzzle is somewhat squared off. The eye sockets are hollowed. The broad, flat nose has a ridgeline across its tip, much in the way that the nostrils of some pre-Roman amber lions are indicated (see, for example, Citation: 77.AO.81.10Cat. no. 36, cat. no. 36). The line extending from the inner canthus alongside the length of the nose is clearly indicated. The underside of the chin is flat. The upper lip puffs out slightly on both sides of the mouth.\nThe poll rises between the base of the horns from a shallow but broad V-shaped incision centered on the forehead; it then spreads outward, curling around and behind the eyes. A pattern of minute, shallow, cross-hatched incisions define the fleece across the forehead and on the cheeks. Shallow, regular incisions circle the horn. The surface is smooth from the point of the ear to the tip of the horn.\nA 1.5 mm perforation runs through the suspension device, which is decorated with a bead-and-reel design.\nDiscussion This pendant has no close parallel.\n","id":71,"length":351,"title":"Pendant","type":"entry","url":"https://gettypubs.github.io/ambers/objects/43/"},{"content":" Provenance 1977, Gordon McLendon (Dallas, TX), donated to the J.

There is a shallow crack on the right cheek. There is a small vertical crack extending from the tip of the nose to the upper lip. The surface, firm with a slight granular appearance, may have been treated with a consolidant. In ambient light, the pendant is dull brown. In transmitted light, the piece is dark red and opaque.\nDescription This pendant is almost cylindrical. The eyes and eye area are plastically modeled: the eyes are almond-shaped; the inner canthus recessed, the lids indicated, the eyebrow arch prominent. The small ears lie flat against the horns. The muzzle is broad and somewhat truncated; the nares are carved in a V-shape. The upper lip is naturalistically full and hangs over the lower one. The throat is almost flat, except for a slight concavity behind the chin. The horns originate from a domed poll, which rises sharply from the plane of the face. The base of each horn has six engraved lines; the rest of the horns\u0026rsquo; surface is smooth. The tips of the horns project outward. At the base is a collar, which is made up of an indented ring and a flaring terminus.\nThe pendant was hung from a triangular system of holes: a 2 mm perforation passes horizontally within the indented ring section of the collar and joins to another perforation 2 mm in diameter in the center of the back.\nDiscussion Despite its small size, this pendant reveals many idiosyncratic elements of the animal: the plastic eye area, the form of the mouth, and the shape of the head.\n","id":72,"length":308,"title":"Pendant","type":"entry","url":"https://gettypubs.github.io/ambers/objects/44/"},{"content":" Provenance 1977, Gordon McLendon (Dallas, TX), donated to the J.

The pendant has a reddish-brown patina, with some yellow mottling at the forehead, at the left naris, and under the chin. The pendant may have been consolidated with amber oil. It is transparent in ambient light. In transmitted light, the pendant is bright orange and fine subsurface cracking is visible. No inclusions are evident.\nDescription The ram of this pendant has a long and sleek head, the tapering muzzle tipping down as in nature. The ocular cavity is simplified, the salient features indicated. The plastic, almond-shaped eyes are defined by a surrounding incised groove. The area below the eye is flat and the arch raised. A short, shallow groove extends downward from the inner corner of the eye toward the deeply incised nares. The division between the face and the fleece is sharp, with the line of the wool sweeping in a curve behind the eyes. The upper edge of the fleece is cut away sharply over each ear, resulting in a ledgelike ridge. Each horn is encircled with fourteen to sixteen closely spaced engraved ridges that extend from the base of the horn to a point just past the intersection of the tip of the ear. The remainder of the horn is smooth. The horns have sharp ends and flare outward. The collar area is narrower in circumference than the neck; it is an inverted flute or flute with narrow fillets on either side.\nA deep groove, 1.5 mm wide, begins at the upper edge of the back and extends 8 mm into the area between the horns, probably the result of removing a fault in the material. Two other grooves, 8 to 10 mm long, also likely resulting from fault removal, are located diagonally across the underside of the neck. Two 1.5 mm perforations were drilled 4 mm apart in the center of the back. The perforations are obstructed with dirt. It is possible that a filament was threaded through the holes. The pendant would have hung head downward.\nDiscussion This head and Citation: 77.AO.81.16Cat. no. 46 (cat. no. 46) look to be by the same hand. The two have a similar diamond-shaped poll and similar widely spaced ridges on the horns. The eyes are plastically modeled, which is especially apparent when viewed on the dorsal side. The upper edge is sharply cut away over each ear, resulting in a ledgelike ridge. In profile, the animals show the same morphological features of the lower part of the head: they both have a long, narrow muzzle with a flat or slightly concave chin and neck. Citation: 77.AO.81.17Cat. no. 47 (cat. no. 47) is very much like this pair, but it has a different decorative finial.

Three—77.AO.81.16, Citation: 77.AO.81.17Cat. no. 47, and Citation: 77.AO.81.19Cat. no. 49—are nearly identical in weight, mass, type, form, and style. All four have nearly identical plastic suspension devices incorporated into the pendant design: in each, a hole is drilled through the neck, and not through the device. Citation: 77.AO.81.18Cat. no. 48 is slightly different, showing a greater affinity to live sheep, the head being higher and deeper, and the angle of the lower skull more natural. The other three heads are in comparison longer and narrower in profile and more slender in top or bottom view. Identical features of all four include the shape of the hollow eyes—hemispheric concavities and heavy overhanging lids, with the fine, irregularly spaced cross-hatching. All four have fleece indicated on the poll, the back of the neck, and the cheeks. The horns of each are carinated from base to tip in a chevron pattern, and in each small ears lie directly on the horns. On the upper side, the ears are cut away, leaving small, shelflike plateaus. On each, the rendering of the ear and the horn is especially careful. The head of 77.AO.81.16 is longer and more slender than the heads of the other four. On all four, tiny V-shaped incisions indicate the nares.\nTraces of tools remain on all the pendants, indicating the use of a sharp tool (or sharp edge) for the cross-hatching, a graver, and abrasive materials for the polishing. Inside one of the sets of holes, the rill marks of a drill are apparent. On all four of the pendants in this group, the hole for suspension is located in the neck, very near to the plane of the back. The holes range in diameter from 1.62 mm to 2.2 mm. 77.AO.81.16 would have hung nose downward.\nDiscussion The differences among the pendants of this group are probably owing to the form of the original drops of amber from which they were made.

Small chip losses are found at the tips of the horns, on the right side of the upper lip, and on the suspension device (bead-and-reel) base. Details are generally soft and surface abraded. The surface is crazed overall; there are no visible inclusions. The piece is a light red-brown with dusty yellow degradation in areas with incised detail and crevices. In transmitted light, the amber is orange.\nDescription The head of the ram is broad, full, and relatively short from nose to base. In profile, the nose is arched; the nares are slightly incised. A U-shaped incision marks the mouth. The ears are cut away on the upper side, leaving small, shelflike plateaus. A ridge indicating the fleece rises sharply from the center of the poll and sweeps around each eye to the cheek. The fleece on the cheeks is rendered by irregularly spaced, shallow cross-hatching. The eyes are unevenly carved, with the right eye shallower and smaller than the left. The outer edges of the horns are carinated and ringed with ridges that extend from the poll to the tip of the ears in a chevron pattern.

A fine fracture line extends from the bottom of the proper left horn to the center of the lower jaw. There is a deep gouge in the throat area and a small deterioration hole in the left cheek. The surface may have been consolidated with amber oil, resulting in a semiglossy, light brown surface color in ambient light. In the incisions are found dusty yellow-brown encrustations. With transmitted light, the amber is translucent and red and an extensive crack network underlying the surface is seen. There are no visible inclusions.\nDescription Viewed dorsally, the ram\u0026rsquo;s head is narrow and triangular, flaring only slightly from the tip of the nose to the back of the head. In profile, the head is more triangular in shape than most rams\u0026rsquo; heads in the Getty group. The plane of the face is delineated from the fleece by a shallow incision. The eye is amygdaloidal in shape, outlined with an engraved line, and a line indicates the tear ducts. The temple area swells slightly above the plane of the face. In profile, the nose curves smoothly downward. The right nostril is carved more deeply and is wider than the left. The ears are plastically modeled and lie flat on the horns. Seven ridges are carved between the root of the horn on the forehead and the intersection with the tip of the ear. In profile, the horns are broad and flat. The chin/throat area has a slight swelling at the jugular notch. The collar area is set off from the animal by a crudely engraved line.

Some dusty yellowish residue is evident in the incisions, and dirt or encrustation remains in the suspension perforation. In ambient light, the pendant is red, shiny, and somewhat translucent. With transmitted light, the amber is orange-red. There is an inclusion in the partially cleaned cavity at the throat.\nDescription In profile view, the head is rectangular, broken only by the downward slope of the nose and the downward tilt of the chin. In top or bottom view, the head is triangular. The neck section is short. The pendant terminates in a pseudo-mount decoration that is larger in circumference than the neck. The somewhat cursory portrayal of the anatomy includes a more specific description of some features. The eyes have a slight bulge above for the arch, are plastic, and display a realistically long tear duct line; the ears show the swelling of the antitragus and the curve of the helix, the chin is swelled and the throat subtly concave. The line of the mouth slants backward and downward from the lips. The ridges of the horns are suggested by five broad grooves between the poll and the ear (the rest is plain). The horn tips flare outward from the face. The cap of fleece is distinguished from the plane of the face by a shallow incision line.\nThe limits of the original shape of the amber nodule might be indicated by the flatness of the horns. Abrasion marks remain along the periphery of the cavity at the throat area. The collar of the pseudo-mount is made up of two engraved lines. On the back is a bead-and-reel–like device consisting of four broad, vertical grooves.

The surface of the amber appears to be crazed and fissures are visible on the underside of the pendant. There is a small chip loss to the lower edge of the nose and a shallow fissure runs part partially across the back. Numerous small scratches mar the surface and may be the result of heavy polishing. The pendant appears to have been treated with amber oil. In ambient light, the amber is red-brown. Some slight subsurface cracking is visible in transmitted light, and the piece is bright red. Many inclusions are present.\nDescription The ram is schematically rendered in comparison to most of the other pendants in the Getty collection. The ram has a broad, semicircular nose and a very low forehead. The muzzle is long and rounded. The horns divide into broad, flat volutes; the ridges on the horns are indicated by five deep and widely spaced horizontal incisions. The ears are represented by sunken amygdaloidal cavities beneath the horns near the top of the head rather than at the sides. A deep incision over the eye and an equally deep incision over the cheek are devices that serve to raise the eye away from the plane of the face. On the back is an oval raised section of amber delineated with five grooves (perhaps a pseudo-suspension finial).\nThere is wearing on the prominent surfaces, but the marks of a graver remain in the cheeks, throat, and chin. The grooves on the back appear to have been made by a sawlike rasping with a straight edge. There are two perforations through the pendant, either of which may have been used for suspension. A small bore, 1 mm in diameter, passes laterally through the pendant at the base of the head; the nostrils are perforated with a 2 mm bore.\nDiscussion This ram has no parallel known to me for the morphology of the animal or the style. I know of no other pseudo-suspension finial. The pendant is of considerable size, one of the largest known, and is comparable to the two largest from the sixth-century Braida di Vaglio Tomb 102.1 Two unusual aspects of this pendant are its two sets of holes and the wear on its prominent areas. It is the only example that has a perforation through the nose. This pendant may have been used at some time as a finial for a necklace, since it is not uncommon for finial heads to meet nose to nose in ancient gold jewelry.\nNotes   For the amber from Tomb 102 at Braida di Vaglio, see introduction, n. 276.

A depression on the left horn may be ancient, as the rest of the horn curves around the flaw. The surface is covered by a thin, light tan alteration crust; freshly exposed areas have deteriorated further to a yellow-ocher. In some areas, the surface appears slightly granular. Additionally, the surface is crazed and has yellowish residue in the cracks. The piece is yellowish gray in ambient light. At the break, the piece is orange. In transmitted light, it is opaque.\nDescription The ram\u0026rsquo;s head is long and slender, with a sloping muzzle. A slight ridge sets the fleece of the poll and cheeks off from the muzzle and horns. The surviving left horn spirals in an oval, with irregular grooves indicating ridges. The eyes are closed. A shallow groove surrounds the muzzle; no other features are indicated.\nA large perforation, 10 mm at the base and narrowing to 3 mm at the tip of the nose, runs through the pendant, likely for suspension. This form of suspension perforation is rare for amber pendants.\nDiscussion The longitudinal suspension perforation and the schematic carving suggest that this head served as the spout of a small vessel, a design element of a ring, or the small finial of a necklace. The last is the most likely since the opening is tapered toward the mouth, and the bottom of the ram\u0026rsquo;s head is not flat. There are few Greek, Etruscan, or Italic examples of longitudinally perforated figured objects in amber or any other material (see also the Getty Lion\u0026rsquo;s Head Citation: 76.AO.81Cat. no. 34, cat. no. 34).\n","id":81,"length":303,"title":"Spout or Finial","type":"entry","url":"https://gettypubs.github.io/ambers/objects/53/"},{"content":"","id":82,"length":"","title":"Other Animal Heads","type":"","url":""},{"content":" Provenance 1977, Gordon McLendon (Dallas, TX), donated to the J.

A large chip on the right ear and small chips on the front of the ears and nares also appear to be recent. The older degradation of the surface has resulted in overall pocking, flaking (especially on the forehead and the reverse of the pendant), and yellow-ocher material that is thickest in the larger craters and crevices, such as the interior of the ears and the line of the mouth. Cracks are found under the chin and along the forehead, brow, and eyes. The cortex varies from brown to dark red-brown in ambient light. In transmitted light, the amber is translucent and a deep reddish orange, and extensive shallow cracking is apparent. There are no visible inclusions.\nDescription Viewed in profile, this piece is slablike. Viewed frontally, the head\u0026rsquo;s rectangularity is emphasized by the width of the muzzle and the flatness of the mouth\u0026rsquo;s lower edge relative to the breadth of the head. The face, nose, and muzzle are smooth and almost level in plane, with the edge of the nares protruding just above it. The upper lip overhangs the lower, a groove separating the lips. The top of the pendant is flat; in front is the suspension spool and behind is the back of the animal\u0026rsquo;s head. Judging from the remains of the breaks, the horns appear to have been about 1.5 mm in diameter at the base, likely curving outward and then upward. The eyes are high on the head, smallish, and plastically rendered, with the right eye in higher relief than the left. The ears, drooping downward, are shaped like short, broad leaves. The left ear is turned backward and is slightly more almond-shaped. The helixes are articulated by raised ridges; the ear openings are recessed. The decorative suspension spool may have replaced the forelock. The reverse side of the pendant, which includes the chin and throat, is nearly flat.\nThe slight face\u0026rsquo;s asymmetry suggests that the pendant may be close in form to the original shape of the amber lump from which it was carved. A 1.5 mm perforation passes laterally through a bead-and-reel device even with the poll of the horns. The suspension device is slightly concave from end to end and is divided into approximately three beads by two grooves. A horizontal groove separates the device from the head. With the device carved into the forward part of the head, the pendant, when suspended, would lie flat, with the chin flush against the surface upon which it lay.\nDiscussion The physiognomy of 77.AO.81.20 is described as much by subtle changes of surface modeling and plastic form as by linear definition. This pendant compares favorably with two other schematic bovine-subject ambers, one in the British Museum (BM 79)1 and another on the London art market. All three, despite their differences in style and morphology, present as hanging, detached heads seen from above. The poll and horns are at the top of the pendant and the muzzle at the bottom. They are flat, and their appearance suggests that they were worked from thin amber nodules. The undersides of all three are plain.\nThe sculptural description of 77.AO.81.20 relies on smooth planar transitions and modeling by abrasion; the others are more harshly worked, with greater use of the graver.\nBovine subjects, not counting two couchant man-headed, bull-bodied pendants in London and Paris,2 are uncommon subjects in the corpus of pre-Roman figured amber. In addition to the three taurine head-pendants, six other amber carvings with bovine subjects are extant. They represent standing or recumbent bulls, cows, and calves. In every case, the head is reverted. The composition of these animals and animal groups follows a time-hallowed couchant type, one of the earliest animal composition types in the Near East.3 The earliest is the calf from the mid-seventh-century Tomb VI grave at Satricum.4 Dating to the end of the sixth century is the recumbent bull (or cow) from Tomb 102 at Braida di Vaglio.5 Three fifth-century examples include the double-subject amber (a recumbent cow or calf and a scallop shell) in Bologna;6 a pendant of a recumbent cow with a milking calf (art market, New York); and a recumbent cow (once in the Gavin McKinley collection).7 The bow decoration of a fibula from Belmonte Piceno (a calf or cow attacked by a lion) is related.8\nTo confirm the sex and age of bovine-subject ambers is essential for understanding why the subject was carved in amber and how such ambers were used, whether during the wearer\u0026rsquo;s lifetime or for funerary purposes. The symbolism of the bull is age-old and is connected to hunting and conquering the animal, to its fertility, and to its guardian role in herd protection. Bull images might be clanic or mythic and symbolize a divinity, hero, ruler, king, or pharaoh. Bull amulets can be classified as amulets of assimilation, conferring directly to the wearer the strength and virility of the animal, or of protection (especially if the subject was thought to symbolize a divinity).9 Bull subjects were not only appropriate for a divinity or royalty; they also may have been specifically appropriate for an infant. As Menander wrote later, “A gold-plated iron ring with a device of ‘bull or goat’ helps to identify a baby.”10\nAlternatively, if the ambers depict a cow rather than a bull, the representation may incorporate other symbolic aspects and divine allusions. From earliest times in Egypt, the cow was considered to embody “all the most admired aspects of motherhood: she was fertile, protective, and provided sustenance for her young,” and “from an equally early period, she was associated with Hathor, and later with Isis and the sky goddess Mehweret.”11 Amulets of a thin frontal bovine head with strongly curving lyre-shaped horns, first found in pre-Dynastic graves, are usually identified as cows\u0026rsquo; heads; they are associated with Bat or Hathor, who by the Middle Kingdom completely assimilated the former and all her attributes.12 From the Eighteenth Dynasty until the end of dynastic history, these amulets were used to depict Hathor.13 As Carol Andrews notes, “Hathor-head amulets made of gold may be a punning reference to her epithet, ‘the golden one.’”14\nIn the ancient Near East, the cow and calf motif is common from the Old Babylonian to the Neo-Assyrian periods and has antecedents in earlier Near Eastern art, significantly in Sumerian art. It often appears to be a divine symbol and has been interpreted as an emblem of Ishtar or, perhaps more probably, of Ninhursaga, and was represented in apotropaic monumental sculpture at least in Urartu.15 A rare Egyptian amulet type of the couchant calf, made of red-glazed faïence or cornelian, is possibly an amulet of rejuvenation.16 A newborn calf in Egypt is the symbol of the infant sun.17 A male kriophoros, or calf-carrier, in Greek art may represent two solar subjects, Apollo and the dawn.\nIn the opinion of this author, the softly modeled Getty pendant represents a cow rather than a bull. If this golden, sun-bright pendant carried with it a Hathoric association, the maternal and protective aspects of the amber object would have been emphasized, for Hathor was celestial mother of the sun calf, protectress of the necropolis, goddess of love and music, nurse of the pharaoh, and consort of Horus.18\nNotes   Citation: Strong 1966Strong, D.

Paul Getty Museum, 1977.\nCondition The amber is intact, but the surface is in poor condition, degraded and grainy, with some old and weathered chipping and loss of surface detail at the tips of the ears and the base of the neck. On the reverse are small recent and larger old chip losses. The surface is blotchy red-brown, overcast by patches of light yellow and a rusty orange alteration surface layer. In transmitted light, the interior is a pale ruby color. There are no visible inclusions.\nDescription The pendant, depicting the head and upper neck of a horse facing to the left, is plain on the reverse and worked on the obverse, with the design flowing onto the contiguous surfaces. The ventral termination occurs at the point just above the larynx, and the dorsal termination is at the base of the mane.\nThe ocular orbit bulges from the continuous raised line of the eyelids and is fullest at the center and depressed at the canthi. The leaflike left ear points straight upward and overlaps the partially represented right ear. The helix of the left ear is indicated by a raised line, while the opening is recessed. At the forehead a small protrusion represents the forelock; one strand of hair, marked by a shallow groove, is indicated below and to the right of the suspension hole.\nFrom the lower edge of the forelock to the tip of the rounded nose, the line of the face is almost straight. The muzzle and nares sweep up around the large circular indentation of the nostril. Below the eye is the protrusion of the cheek, gently undercut to emphasize the bulge of the nares. The line from the jaw to the mouth bows gently outward and is fullest through the cheek.\nBehind the head is the fall of the mane, the hair rendered by eight unevenly spaced vertical grooves set at a slight diagonal angle, parallel to the slant of the head. The edge of the mane is rounded but uneven and is set off from the flank by a groove. Between the mane and the head is a triangular section of amber representing the chest of the horse. The head is turned slightly toward the front.\nThe oblong contour, concave reverse, and convex obverse imply the shape of the original amber nodule. At the lower edge of the mane is a grooved indentation probably created by the removal of a fault. Rare evidence of the use of a pushed or driven tool is seen in the channel under the chin, which retains a succession of rippled cuts along the bottom, typical of a gouging tool. A 4.5 mm perforation for suspension passes through the front of the poll and exits behind the ears. Between them, cleverly worked into the design, is a stopped bore, likely a mortise for some kind of addition. When the pendant is suspended from the perforation, it is diamond-shaped, with the muzzle angled downward and the large, almond-shaped eye tilted upward.\nDiscussion This head represents a horse as if in movement. Although it differs somewhat in style and type, it is of the same general form as three of the five other amber pendants of horse subjects known, a pendant in New York,1 a pendant in a London private collection; and another on the Swiss art market.2 Each one includes the head and neck of the animal in profile, with the head brought close to the body, the inside profile adjacent to the neck, and the neck arched. The animal is couped just above the jugular notch. Each example is perforated so that the horses\u0026rsquo; heads are in natural positions of movement.\n77.AO.81.6 is discussed here as the head of a horse, but on the analogy of the representation of some hippocamps in Etruscan art, particularly, it may in fact be the head of a hippocamp (see entry for Citation: 78.AO.286.1Cat. no. 29, cat. no. 29).\nTwo other horse heads are each of different types. One is from a controlled excavation, Tomb 955 at Lavello-Casino, a “princely” tomb that provides important information about the context of figured ambers in the Basilicata.3 The woman buried in the fifth-century tomb was adorned with rich hair and body ornaments, including a girdle with five amber pendants. The largest is a pendant in the form of the foreparts of a rearing bridled horse; three others are illegible, and the fifth is a large female profile head-pendant. The other horse subject is a pendant in London (British Museum 62, identified by Donald Strong as a grotesque head).4 The Getty, New York, and London private collection pendants all have a double incised line at the bottom of the head that emphasizes their bustlike format, and perhaps their meaning.5\nThe Getty horse\u0026rsquo;s head is an artistic combination of a patterned representation and subtle modeling, suggesting that the carver integrated firsthand knowledge of the animal into an established prototype. The amber can be compared to Greek and Italian sculpture and vase painting of the Archaic period. The shape and proportion of the almond-shaped eye (like all amber carvings, it is characteristically without an incised pupil), the large fleshy nose with round nostril, the form of the mane and especially the poll, may reveal the artistic heritage of the Getty amber. The horse is of the type first seen in Orientalizing Greek vase painting of the seventh century; for instance, the horses in the lion-hunt scene on the Chigi vase (a proto-Corinthian olpe from Veii) or on the Melian ware amphora in Athens decorated with a representation of the Wedding of Herakles.6 Its lineage can be traced to horses on Etrusco-Corinthian vases; and it is not far from horses and hippocamps painted on Etruscan black-figure wares. Sculptural comparisons from Etruria and south Italy, especially, demonstrate its Italian heritage, among them the bronze horse and rider from Grumento, of the mid-sixth century,7 a bronze horse of the late sixth century, said to be from Locri, in New York,8 and a hand-modeled terracotta (likely a patrice, or model for a mold) of a horse in Basel from around 600.9\nThe horse\u0026rsquo;s head is a popular subject in sixth-century Greek and Etruscan vase painting and in Etruscan bucchero; it is found on coins, gems, bronze work, and funerary reliefs. Horses\u0026rsquo; heads are one of the many shapes of East Greece aryballoi.10 Horses\u0026rsquo; heads are often paired on bronze and bucchero objects.11 (Some seem to be of hippocamps rather than horses.) Some scholars believe the large, bridled horses of one class of Attic black-figure amphorae (fl. end of the seventh century to the middle of the sixth) are the predecessors of the Panthenaic prize amphorae for equine events,12 but they may have played roles in other ceremonies or in funerary ritual.\nThe most likely explanation for the horses\u0026rsquo; heads that encircle bucchero oinochoai and other shapes is that they had a funerary meaning. The number of vases, including plastic vases in the form of horses\u0026rsquo; heads, which have come from tombs, suggests a direct connection between the subject, the tomb, and afterworld concerns, a possibility that deserves further attention. (This is not to deny the importance of the horse as a status symbol, its class and clanic associations, and the importance of horses in the elite culture of South Italy particularly.) The meaning of the horse\u0026rsquo;s head in other contexts may shed light on the subject\u0026rsquo;s “activity” as an ornament or amulet. On an Early Corinthian alabastron from Rhodes, what is the role of the curiously inserted large horse\u0026rsquo;s head behind a centaur who grasps the arm of a woman? Does the scene represent Cheiron and Chariklo?13 Horses\u0026rsquo; heads appear on some large early-fourth-century Metapontine terracotta reliefs of Dionysos-Hades reclining with a kantharos in hand (he is also joined by Kore and Iacchos): here the context of the horse\u0026rsquo;s head is directly connected to the cult of Dionysos-Hades.14\nIn the ancient Near East, the horse\u0026rsquo;s head, as Jeremy Black and Anthony Green point out, occurs as a divine symbol on a seal of second-millennium date and on Neo-Assyrian seals, as well as on a kudurru of the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar I (r. 1125–1104 B.C.), where a horse\u0026rsquo;s head may represent a constellation. In the Neo-Assyrian period, the horse is the animal of the sun-god Šamaš (Utu), based on the associated winged disk.15\nWhy an ornament or amulet in the form of a horse\u0026rsquo;s head? The subject is ancient: among the oldest known amber amulets from the Baltic is an equine (or elk\u0026rsquo;s) head amulet of the Neolithic period.16 The single horse\u0026rsquo;s head is a rare subject in Egypt, the Aegean Islands, and Greece, which makes the subject\u0026rsquo;s appearance in the Phoenician world stand out. A significant find from Orientalizing Italy is a Phoenician ivory protome in the form of a bridled, teeth-baring horse, which was included in the furnishings of the Barberini Tomb at Praeneste.17\nWorn in life, the amber horse\u0026rsquo;s head as pendant may have functioned as a sign of status: the horse, horse ownership, and the cavalier in the ancient world were markers of the political-religious elite. The horse might have acted as a metonym, naming the wearer as beautiful, or it might have alluded to the power of the horse-tamers of religio-mythological realms, or more directly to a heroic ancestor. As a permanent amulet, used in direct or aggressive magic, a horse\u0026rsquo;s head might have conferred on its wearer the qualities affiliated with the horse or horse ownership, or the qualities of a deity or hero whose attribute was equine. A shining golden horse carved from solar amber could recall the great steeds that drew the chariot of the sun across the sky. Through magical assimilation, the wearer would be linked to Apollo, Eos, or Phaethon, for example. The link between the chariot of the sun, the new sun, and new life would follow on and link it to the age-old beliefs about the solar aspects of amber. Phaethon, Apollo\u0026rsquo;s son, never suffered old age, became immortal, and was mourned in perpetuity by his sisters, who wept tears of amber. Eos, or the Etruscan Thesan, is the manifestation of the morning sun and aggressively abducts and pursues young men, who, too, will deny death. Thesan is an important solar and kourotrophic deity in Etruscan religion, and as A. Carpino reminds us, Thesan\u0026rsquo;s love “could result in the attainment of immortality—the triumph over death.”18 In death, as a badge, a horse\u0026rsquo;s head might also have brought to believers a lasting tie with the cult of Dionysos-Hades, securing the powers of the divinity for an individual\u0026rsquo;s salvation after death.\nA horse\u0026rsquo;s head made from amber may have had added powers in warding away pain, for the horse was one of the many amulet types prescribed in Late Antiquity for abdominal pain19 (which could include womb pain). As such, it would work in a “like banishes like” manner. An amber horse\u0026rsquo;s head might ward off particular demons and dangers not only in life, but also after death, in the grave and on the voyage to the afterworld. If amber by itself could bring light into the tomb and symbolize the sun\u0026rsquo;s regenerative power, a horse might bring it with the speed of the gods. At the very least, a horse\u0026rsquo;s head could continue its protective and danger-averting functions, perpetually guarding the tomb.\nNotes   Metropolitan Museum of Art 24.97.117: Citation: Richter 1940Richter, G.

Paul Getty Museum, 1977.\nCondition The piece is broken off at the neck area at a fissure; the tip of the left ear is missing. There are overall surface cracks. Large fissures are found at the jaw, at the mouth, on the cheek, and on much of the surface of the reverse. The surface has a thick, pale yellow deterioration crust, but little flaking has occurred; there is a cloudy area at the jaw. In ambient light, the piece is entirely opaque, predominantly yellowish tan, with patches of reddish brown on the nose and temple area. In other areas, such as below the eye, ear, and at the back (neck area), the amber is gray. In transmitted light, the piece is light orange. There are numerous inclusions.\nDescription The obverse is convex and figured with the animal\u0026rsquo;s head and neck facing left. The head is long and elliptical; the neck terminates at the right side in a curved irregular line that runs from the withers to the throatlatch. There is no indication of a mane. The eye is almond-shaped and has thick eyelids. The outside canthus turns downward. The bridge of the nose is rounded, with a large tip and rounded nostril. The mouth is open as if in laughter. Only the left ear is represented. It is upright and leaf-shaped, with the helix indicated by a raised line; the ear opening is recessed.\nThe form of the head seems to take advantage of the natural protrusions and undulations of the amber piece from which it was carved. The amber\u0026rsquo;s shape may have been very like the finished product and may even have directed the subject and its disposition: the mouth seems to have been worked from a cleaned-out fissure, the jaw and eye from natural protuberances; the long ear appears to incorporate a depression; and the eye may have been formed from a small dome left raised above the surface of the face. On the back of the head, near the break, is a section of the suspension perforation. The pendant is drilled with three large stopped bores, all about 5 mm in diameter. One bore enters just under the chin, proceeding upward for about 11 mm; a second, about 4 mm deep, enters the rear of the head and passes horizontally toward the front of the pendant; the third bore is on the reverse of the figure and proceeds to a depth of 13 mm.\nDiscussion The terms ass and donkey are often interchanged today, and there appears also to have been some confusion in antiquity concerning representations of the non-horse species of Equus equidae. Despite the schematic nature of the carving, the maker of the amber has emphasized the subject\u0026rsquo;s asinine character: the animal is maneless, the ears are long, the nose is cupped at midlength, the muzzle is rounded, and the mouth is open as if braying. It seems even to be a specific breed, the wild ass, which, originally found in Africa, was domesticated by the third millennium. (Many variants of the wild ass have been bred for thousands of years and include donkeys.)\nOne other possible asinine-form amber is a head in the Vatican collections (findspot unrecorded), which, until now, has been considered a horse.1 It is said to belong to a fibula (although it looks like a pendant) and was acquired at the same time as a second (much degraded) figured amber that represents a bearded male in half-figure, who is carrying a pithos on his back (his arms reach backward). The head shape, ear position, ruff of hair on the jaw, and sparse mane, as well as the toothy grin, suggest to me an asinine rather than an equine subject. The style of the Vatican amber is entirely different from that of the Getty head. They differ also in manufacture.\nWhy an asinine amber? The association of asinine beasts with Dionysos, whose link with amber is well established, may be one reason. The ass served as transportation for Dionysos, and its presence might indicate the “hidden god” by association. An Attic rhyton in the form of a braying ass from Tomb 43 at Melfi-Pisciolo (Basilicata), a male tomb from the second half of the fifth century, is a tangible recognition of the Dionysian presence.2 As Sarah Iles Johnston points out, the ass, the bird of prey, the horse, and the wolf were “the four animals whose traits the child-killer [demon] borrows in extant sources.”3 The ass is not usually a demonic animal in ancient Greece or anywhere else: the two exceptions are the association of the ass with the Egyptian Seth or Typhon and with the Near Eastern Lamashtu.4 Johnston explains,\n Lamashtu is often shown with ass\u0026rsquo;s teeth and ass\u0026rsquo;s ears on amuletic plaques and these teeth and ears are mentioned in ritual texts. Once, she is said to have an ass\u0026rsquo;s form. Once, she is adjured to go away, like a savage ass! Body parts of asses can be used in amulets against Lamashtu, which may be a case of similia similibus. 5\n Like the hyena, the ass was believed to have several obstetrical and pediatric uses, judging by Pliny\u0026rsquo;s remarks in book 28 of the Natural History,6 where an ass\u0026rsquo;s liver, worn as an amulet, was said to protect babies from epileptic fits. In Johnston\u0026rsquo;s view, most recommended uses for ass parts in the magical papyri refer to the asinine form of Seth-Typhon and the “significance of the ass eventually became more broadly applied, too, so that it became a sort of all-purpose demonic animal, and its body parts became all-purpose amulets.”7 Campbell Bonner links the subject of the ass with aggressive amulets for women\u0026rsquo;s pain in the abdomen (which in antiquity included the womb).8 The roughly carved Getty pendant might even be said to be ugly, which might have aided its efficacy.9 At the very least, an asinine amber was a potent amulet of healing. To be buried with a clamoring ass would be to be interred with an alert animal, ready to bray and avert danger.\nNotes   Vatican Museums, Museo Etrusco Gregoriano, inv. 13410. ↩ Melfi, Museo Archeologico Nazionale del Melfese “Massimo Pallottino” 51488: Citation: Magie d\u0026rsquo;ambra 2005Magie d\u0026rsquo;ambra: Amuleti e gioielli della Basilicata antica.

It has been a source of both mystery and curiosity, as it bridges the divide between the living and organic and the mineral and inorganic. It was initially selected for qualities such as color and hardness, with an eye toward an end market in jewelry production, and the Baltic Sea coastline has, and continues to be, the largest source of the material.\nThe focus of amber studies over the past two hundred years has paralleled scientific developments in instrumentation and methods. Some of the earliest investigators used microscopy to view a hidden world of natural history and provide insights into past geological ages. More recent studies have analyzed the material itself in an attempt to better understand its chemistry, origins, and deterioration processes. This has included the identification of imitation ambers composed of natural and man-made compounds.1\nAmber Characteristics Although amber types have been classified generally, some ambiguities remain. Visual characteristics of amber such as color and translucency do not clearly relate to differences in chemical composition, 2 and some differences may relate more closely to inclusions, entrapment of air, and states of oxidation. Amber may also be defined by grade, color, or even by geographic origin, such as Romanian or Sicilian. Ambers such as Baltic may be further subdivided into the categories allingite, beckerite, gedanite, or glessite, based in part on opacity, color, and friability.3 Some subdivisions are also morphological. For example, amber with many tiny bubbles may be termed “bone” amber, whereas “foamy” amber has slightly larger bubbles. Amber typing can, therefore, be viewed from different perspectives ranging from morphological to chemical.\nAmber Deterioration and Conservation Although amber may have lain relatively dormant in geological deposits for thousands of years, its relatively recent collection, shaping, use, and reburial has often resulted in continued—and in some instances severe—deterioration. In general, deterioration manifests itself as a thick “corrosion” crust that not only obscures the translucent quality of amber but may also lead to flaking and loss of the carved surface. In the worst-case scenarios, the carved surface completely flakes off, leaving an ambiguously shaped amber core. Deterioration may continue in a collections environment and be aggravated by pollutants, oxidation processes, and inappropriate environmental controls.4 Recently, the degradation mechanisms and conservation treatments of archaeological amber have been studied using a variety of analytical instrumentation.5\nOver the years, restorers and, more recently, conservators have attempted to reinforce fragile amber surfaces by applying a range of consolidative organic materials. Examples of past amber consolidants include dammar resin and “amber oil,” a product of amber distillation.6 A variety of waxes and natural and synthetic resins have also been applied. While preserving the morphological characteristics of carved amber, organic consolidants may interfere with future attempts to analyze or classify the amber. Therefore, the consolidation process should be carefully considered and, if carried out, fully documented.7\nScientific Analysis of Amber The study of amber has kept pace over the last two centuries with the developments in scientific analysis. Microscopic studies beginning in the eighteenth century focused on the morphological characteristics of amber and the recognition of amber\u0026rsquo;s botanical origins.8 As methods for chemical analysis developed, so did the understanding of amber\u0026rsquo;s complex chemical structure.9 Considering the archaeological context of many amber finds, its characterization is further complicated by material degradation and possible interference from a past stabilization treatment.10 Beginning in the 1960s, analytical studies of amber relied heavily on infrared spectroscopy (IR)11 and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).\nIR spectroscopy, in particular, was the first technique capable of readily identifying Baltic amber through the presence of a distinct succinic acid peak or “shoulder” in its infrared spectrum. However, the limits of this method were reached when it proved less successful in distinguishing between non-Baltic ambers. More recent analytical studies have employed Raman spectroscopy, 12 capillary gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), 13 and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), 14 which are capable of isolating a broad range of compounds that compose amber.15 Combined with other analysis, this has led to proposals for the botanical origins of some ambers as well as common sourcing for previously distinct ambers.16\nCurrent Research The primary goal of the scientific investigation of a group of amber objects from the collections of the J. Paul Getty Museum was to verify that the ambers were indeed of Baltic origin. A secondary aim was to ascertain whether treatment with amber oil or other organic materials might interfere with the identification process. Samples were removed from the cores of 26 amber objects for analysis at the Getty Conservation Institute using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry with tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (THM-Py-GC/MS). In addition to the core samples, surface samples were also removed from seven amber objects in order to better understand the composition of weathered amber surfaces. For comparative purposes, tests were carried out on a number of reference materials, including Baltic amber, Dominican amber, copal resin, pine resin, sandarac resin, dried residue from amber oil distillate, and amber varnish.\nFourier-Transform Infrared Spectrometry Procedure The samples were analyzed on a Nic-plan infrared microscope equipped with a nitrogen cooled MCT/A detector. Selected amber particles were placed on an infrared diamond window, flattened with a metal roller and analyzed using a transmitted infrared beam apertured to 100 x 100 microns. The spectra are the sum of 100 scans at a resolution of 4 cm-1. Infrared analysis of the samples produced spectra containing bands that correspond to amber. For example, a characteristic peak attributed to the carbon-oxygen bond at 1158 cm-1 distinguishes Baltic amber. Additional bands at 1737 and 1715 cm-1 are assigned to the ester and carboxylic acid groups, whereas peaks located at 1643 and 888 cm-1 are attributed to the exocyclic methylene group. Other components may be present in the samples at concentrations below the detection limit (5%).\nTHM-Pyrolysis-Gas Chromatography/ Mass Spectrometry Procedure Samples were tested on an HP 5972 gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer using a CDS Pyroprobe 2000, fitted with a valved interface at 330°C and purged with helium at 25 ml/minute. The split injector was at 340°C (30:1 ratio), and the MS transfer line was set to 300°C. A DB-5MS capillary column (30 M x 0.25 mm x 0.25 µm) was used with helium at 44cm/sec. The GC oven temperature program was 2 minutes at 40°C, then 6°C/minute to 310°C, and 13-minute isothermal. The solvent delay was 2.5 minutes. The mass spectrometer was scanned from m/z 35–700. Samples were placed into quartz tubes fitted with quartz wool, and three microliters of 25% tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH) in methanol were introduced for derivatization. After three minutes, the tube was placed into a coiled filament probe, which was inserted into the valved interface. After purging for three seconds before pyrolysis, samples were pyrolyzed using the following temperature program: 200°C for 1 second, then ramped at 10°C/millisecond to 700°C, and held isothermally for 10 seconds.\nFigure 1, an overlay of the FTIR spectra for Baltic amber and an amber object ( Citation: 76.AO.84Cat. no. 37, cat. no. 37), reveals characteristic spectral differences that make it possible to positively identify Baltic amber. The infrared spectrum of Baltic amber shows characteristic intense absorption bands at 2926, 2867, and 2849 cm-1 attributed to C-H stretching modes of the CH2 and CH3 groups. A doublet for carbonyl C=O stretching peaks at 1739 and 1714 cm-1 is characteristic of ester and acid groups. Additional bands at 1260 and 1157 cm-1 are assigned to CO-O- modes of the succinate group, whereas the C-H bending modes for the terminal olefins are located at 888 cm-1. Finally, peaks located at 1643 and 888 cm-1 are attributed to the exocyclic methylene group.\n FTIR Results for Baltic Amber and Amber Object 76.AO.84   fullscreen    FTIR Results for Baltic Amber and Amber Object 76.AO.84    In THM-Py-GC/MS results for Baltic and Dominican amber standards (figure 2), a total of 69 compounds were identified. Many of these are sesquiterpene and diterpene compounds that are abundant, though not especially characteristic of the type of amber, as well as numerous nonspecific compounds. Succinic acid is the dominant marker compound for Baltic amber, and it appears in the chromatogram as a large peak at 10.3 minutes. In this study, succinic acid was analyzed in the form of the dimethyl ester derivative, and is abbreviated in figures as succinate. In figure 3, which shows THM-Py-GC/MS results for amber object 82.AC.161.285, other Baltic amber marker compounds are present in varying amounts, including fenchol, borneol, camphene, and camphor. Two very small peaks identified as methyl fenchyl succinate and methyl bornyl succinate (Mills et al. 1984) may also appear in THM-Py-GC/MS results for Baltic ambers.\n THM-Py-GC/MS Results for Baltic and Dominican Ambers   fullscreen    THM-Py-GC/MS Results for Baltic and Dominican Ambers     THM-Py-GC/MS Results for Core Sample from Amber Object 82.AC.161.285   fullscreen    THM-Py-GC/MS Results for Core Sample from Amber Object 82.AC.161.285    Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4 list the various classes of compounds identified in the THM-Py-GC/MS analysis results of the amber objects and the reference materials. The identifications were based primarily on the results from mass spectral library searching using the NIST MS Search 2.0 program, and supplemented by published data (Mills et al. 1984). Although the NIST results of the nonspecific compounds listed in table 5 were inconclusive, the unknown compounds did appear on a rather consistent basis in the objects.\nThe THM-Py-GC/MS results for the reference samples appear in table 6. In this and all subsequent tables, the test results are expressed in terms of peak-area percentages relative to the total peak area for all of the compounds listed in tables 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (except for methyl fenchyl succinate, methyl bornyl succinate, and dibornyl succinate, which, due to their extremely small peak sizes, did not contribute significantly to the total peak area). Table 6 shows that the succinate content in the single known sample of Baltic amber was high, whereas almost no succinate was detected in the Dominican ambers, copal resin, sandarac resin, or pine resin. The succinate content in the ambers of unknown origin appeared rather variable, but the presence of the other markers in table 1 placed them firmly in the Baltic category. The “amber varnish” was found to contain a high concentration of a drying oil with no detectable succinate content. Fortunately, the test results for dried amber oil residue showed no significant amounts of any of the Baltic marker compounds listed in table 1 except for borneol, indicating that amber oil treatment should not produce a “false positive” identification for Baltic amber.\nIn the THM-Py-GC/MS results for the core samples from the untreated amber objects (table 7, the most striking feature is the remarkably broad range for the succinate content compared to the composition of the standards. In an overlay of FTIR spectra for some of these samples (figure 4), the main trend is the shift of the carbonyl peak to lower wavenumber with increasing succinate content, which is characteristic of the conversion of esters to carboxylic acids. These results provide evidence that partial hydrolysis of the succinate esters in the objects has occurred, which is a reaction that would enrich the residual amber in succinic acid.\n Variation in FTIR Spectrum with Succinate Content for Amber Objects (Core Samples)   fullscreen    Variation in FTIR Spectrum with Succinate Content for Amber Objects (Core Samples)    One concern in this study was that the composition of the surface crusts of the amber objects might be considerably different from that of the inner cores due to hydrolysis, weathering, handling, and treatment. This is why core samples were removed from the objects by microdrilling. In figure 5, the THM-Py-GC/MS results for the dark surface and inner core of a large piece of reference amber, it is clear that the surface has become partially depleted in succinate, with little other changes apparent. Table 8 shows the results for pairs of surface and core samples for the amber objects, and figure 6 shows a typical chromatographic result ( Citation: 83.AO.202.1Cat. no. 12, cat. no. 12). The surfaces of these objects have also been depleted in succinate, but the sesquiterpenes and diterpenes also have been radically reduced. These compounds are not chemically bound to the polymeric network of the amber, which would make them more susceptible to leaching during burial.\n THM-Py-GC/MS Results for Dark Surface and Inner Core of Amber from Verfmolen ‘De Kat’   fullscreen    THM-Py-GC/MS Results for Dark Surface and Inner Core of Amber from Verfmolen ‘De Kat’     THM-Py-GC/MS Results for Surface and Inner Core Samples from 83.AO.202.1   fullscreen    THM-Py-GC/MS Results for Surface and Inner Core Samples from 83.AO.202.1    FTIR analysis also reveals important details about the nature of the surface and core compositions. Figure 7 shows FTIR spectra for surface and core samples from Citation: 83.AO.202.1Cat. no. 12. The saturated C-H bands at 2927 and 2869 cm-1 in the spectrum of the surface sample are reduced, whereas the C-O stretching modes at 1159 cm-1 in the fingerprint region are more intense. This indicates the surface is more highly oxidized than the core. The other important peak appears at 1574 cm-1, which is due to salts of succinic acid. There is a much higher concentration of succinate salts in the surface sample, which is consistent with exposure to alkaline conditions during some period of time.17 This might have occurred during burial, or from harsh cleaning with alkaline chemicals. FTIR spectra of two surface samples and the core from Citation: 82.AO.161.7Cat. no. 24 (cat. no. 24) (figure 8) show the increased O-H stretching band in the surface sample, with a shift in the C=O band to lower wavenumbers, indicating the prevalence of carboxylic acids. However, the succinate salt peak at 1574 cm-1 is only a slight shoulder on the carbonyl peak, indicating that this object was not exposed to the same harsh alkaline conditions of Citation: 83.AO.202.1Cat. no. 12.\n FTIR Spectra for Surface and Core Samples from 83.AO.202.1   fullscreen    FTIR Spectra for Surface and Core Samples from 83.AO.202.1     FTIR Spectra for Surface and Core Samples from 82.AO.161.7   fullscreen    FTIR Spectra for Surface and Core Samples from 82.AO.161.7    Table 9 lists the THM-Py-GC/MS results for the treated amber objects, and representative chromatograms are shown in figure 9. Azelaic acid was detected in three of the objects: Citation: 77.AO.81.29Cat. no. 16 (cat. no. 16), Citation: 77.AO.81.5Cat. no. 23 (cat. no. 23), and the surface of Citation: 77.AO.81.30Cat. no. 25 (cat. no. 25). This is a common marker compound for cross-linked drying oils, and its presence along with palmitic acid and stearic acid indicates that drying oils may have been applied to these objects in an alternative type of conservation treatment. In Citation: 77.AO.81.4Cat. no. 14 (cat. no. 14), palmitic and stearic acids were detected along with cholesterol, but azelaic acid is absent. This suggests that an animal fat could have been applied to this object as another type of alternative treatment. Three amber objects tested in this study had been previously treated with amber oil: Citation: 77.AO.84Cat. no. 1 (cat. no. 1), Citation: 77.AO.83Cat. no. 38 (cat. no. 38), and Citation: 77.AO.81.7Cat. no. 41 (cat. no. 41). Their extremely high succinate contents suggest that they were highly degraded prior to treatment. In figure 10, the FTIR spectra for selected treated samples show that treatment with drying oil or amber oil does not interfere with the identification of Baltic amber.\n THM-Py-GC/MS Results for Surface Samples from Treated Amber Objects   fullscreen    THM-Py-GC/MS Results for Surface Samples from Treated Amber Objects     FTIR Results for Core Samples from Treated Amber Objects   fullscreen    FTIR Results for Core Samples from Treated Amber Objects    Conclusions This study has demonstrated that chemical analysis using FTIR and THM-Py-GC/MS can provide rich details concerning the composition of antique amber objects. Fundamentally, the analytical results showed that all of the amber objects in the J. Paul Getty Museum are classified as Baltic amber. Additional information revealed the nature and extent of deterioration, and provided tantalizing hints about the nature of the burial conditions to which some of these objects may have been exposed. Finally, detection of certain marker compounds has shown that a number of amber objects were treated with drying oils and fats and, furthermore, that amber oil treatment does not interfere with the provenancing process.\nTable 1: Marker Compounds from THM-Py-GC/MS Analysis of Amber    IUPAC Name Synonym CAS #

Thickett discusses the problems of consolidant removal and the effects of solvents on amber in “The influence of solvents on the analysis of amber,” in Conservation science in the UK: preprints of the meeting held in Glasgow May 1993, edited by Norman J. Tennent (London, 1993), pp. 49–56. ↩ The earliest IR studies of amber were carried out most notably by J. Langenheim, C. Beck, and R. Rottländer. See, for example, Beck, C., and H. Hartnett, “Sicilian amber,” in Amber in archaeology: proceedings of the second international conference on amber in archaeology, Liblice, 1990 (Prague, 1993), pp. 36–47, and Beck, C., “Spectroscopic investigations of amber,” Applied Spectroscopy Reviews 22, no. 1 (1986), pp. 57–110. Amber studies have benefited from further developments in infrared spectroscopy such as Fourier-transform (FTIR), diffuse-reflectance infrared Fourier-transform (DRIFT), and Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR) FTIR. For the DRIFT method, see Angelini, I., and P. Bellintani, “Archaeological ambers from Northern Italy: An FTIR-DRIFT study of provenance by comparison with the geological amber database,” Archaeometry 47, no. 2 (2005), pp. 441–54. For the ATR method, see Guiliano, M., L. Asia, G. Onoratini, and G.

For comprehensive overviews of the method, see “The application of analytical pyrolysis to the study of cultural materials,” chap. 6 in Applied Pyrolysis Handbook, 2nd ed., ed. Thomas Wampler (Boca Raton, FL, 2007), pp. 105–31. ↩ Gas chromatography effectively separates volatile, solvent-extractable components, which are subsequently detected and analyzed by the mass spectrometer. The limit to analyzing only the extractable components is mostly overcome by pyrolyzing the sample before the analysis. Pyrolysis uses thermal energy to break down polymeric and non-volatile materials into small volatile molecules that are amenable to gas chromatographic analysis. ↩ Stout, E., C. W. Beck, and K. B.

The first and most important thanks go to the Antiquities Department at the J. Paul Getty Museum, Kenneth Lapatin, Claire Lyons, Mary Louise Hart, Jens Daehner, and David Saunders; and to former department staff Jiří Frel, Kenneth Hamma, Marit Jentoft-Nilsen, Karol Wight, and Marion True. Recently, Alexandra Sofroniew, Antiquities Department assistant curator, with keen eye and deft hand, has greatly aided the transformation of the manuscript into the book and this online catalogue. In Antiquities Conservation, heartfelt appreciation goes to Jerry Podany, Jeffrey Maish, and to former staff member Maya Elston. Michael Shilling and Herant Khanjian of the Getty Conservation Institute provided critical scientific analysis. In the director’s office, David Bomford, Stephen Garrett, and John Walsh in turn offered support at important junctures. The beautiful photography by Ellen Rosenbery speaks for itself. Benedicte Gilman and Mark Greenberg, the original supporters at Getty Publications, are owed more than appreciative words. Ann Lucke and Rob Flynn deftly picked up where they left off. The online catalogue is the result of the talents of designer Kurt Hauser, production coordinators Elizabeth Zozom and Elizabeth Kahn, assistant editor Ruth Evans Lane, and software architects Brenda Podemski and Roger Howard. The expertise of the Web Group, particularly Jack Ludden and Susan Edwards, has been invaluable. The anonymous reader offered priceless comments. Cindy Bohn, manuscript editor, deserves commendation for her skill and patience, as do Laura Harger and Greg Dobie. Last, but certainly not least, without Marina Belozerskaya, guide and lantern, the project would have been benighted long ago.\nTwo great libraries and their staffs call for special mention, the library at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, my home institution, and that of the Getty Research Institute, where I have been a Reader since it opened. Neal Turtell, Lamia Doumato, Thomas McGill, Jr., and Ted Dalziel (in Washington), and Anne-Mieke Halbrook and Susan Allen (at the Getty) represent the best in art librarianship. I would also like to recognize the help given to me over the years by the library staff of the American Academy in Rome; the University of California, Los Angeles; the University of California, Riverside; the University of California, Santa Barbara; the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute; and Edinburgh University.\nThroughout my tenure at the National Gallery of Art, I have had superb administrative support, and I thank for it Rusty Powell, Alan Shestack, Franklin Kelly, Elizabeth Pochter, and Lynn Russell. The help offered by colleagues while I was on sabbatical in Edinburgh during an Ailsa Mellon Bruce Curatorial Fellowship at the Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts at the National Gallery of Art and during a Summer Fellowship at the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute greatly affected the outcome of the publication. In Williamstown, special thanks are offered to Michael Ann Holly, Mark Ledbury, and Richard Rand; in Washington, to deans past and present Henry A. Millon, Elizabeth Cropper, Therese O’Malley, and Peter Lukehart. The grants and fellowships supporting research abroad began with a Samuel H. Kress Traveling Fellowship. Summer grants from California State University, Long Beach, made possible the first Italian sojourns. Two Robert H. Smith Fellowships awarded by the National Gallery of Art were critical to research in Greek and Italian museums.\nAny museum-based endeavor is a complex project, and institutions housing archaeological finds, especially fragile collections, present special challenges. I owe a debt of gratitude to the many people around the world who aided me in the firsthand study of amber objects. At museums in Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany (once East and West), Greece, Hungary, Italy, Mexico, Russia, Serbia, Slovenia, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States, curators, conservators, registrars, scientists, photographers, and other professionals were instrumental to the research. Particular appreciation is owed to Joan Mertens and Carlos Picón of The Metropolitan Museum of Art; Denis Haynes and Dyfri Williams of the British Museum; Alain Pasquier of the Louvre; Mary B. Comstock, John Herrmann, and Cornelius C. Vermeule of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; Jan Bouzek of the Classical Institute of Archaeology, Charles University, Prague; János György Szilágyi of the Fine Arts Museum, Budapest; Elena Khodza at the State Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg; and David Grimaldi of the American Museum of Natural History, New York. Gavin Hamilton, Leon Levy and Shelby White, and Judy and Michael Steinhardt kindly welcomed study of their private collections. Without the generous help of specific scholars and curators in Italy, this project would not have progressed. Among Italian colleagues, I extend particular thanks to Sebastiano Bianco, Nuccia Negroni Catacchio, Giulia Rocco, and Marcello Tagliente.\nSubstantial recognition goes to my Doktorvater, Mario Del Chiaro, and to my former graduate students and research assistants in California and Washington. First on the list are the Angelenos Maureen Burns, John Tucker, René Ninaber, and Anna Zagorski. Alexis Castor and Bjoern Ewalt were ideal research associates at the Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts. In Washington, Patrick Resing and Jack Shepherd performed key editorial work. Lee B. Ewing, photographer, National Gallery of Art, offered new insights. Amber life and work were much ameliorated by my Academic Programs Department colleagues Ana Maria Zavala Kozuch, Ben Masri-Cohen, Ali Peil, Rachel Schulze, and Jennifer Wagelie.\nWithout the support of family and friends, this work would not have reached daylight. Selma Holo and Fred Croton read and listened to the unfolding story. Alan Conisbee and Marie Clarke offered more than engineering insight. My grandmother and parents, Elizabeth Lees, Willard Causey, Catherine Causey-Lees, and my siblings C. Andrew Causey, Douglas Causey, Kay Marie Kuder, and Laurel Nelson provided not only encouragement over the years but also keen editorial eyes. Andrew’s contributions go far beyond art and anthropology. To my son, Jan, and to the memory of Philip, this book is dedicated.\n","id":89,"length":982,"title":"Acknowledgments","type":"page","url":"https://gettypubs.github.io/ambers/acknowledgments/"},{"content":" Abbreviations          AA Archäologischer Anzeiger   ABV Beazley, J.

Paul Getty Museum’s collection—the second largest body of this material in the United States and one of the most important in the world. The fifty-six Etruscan, Greek, and Italic carved ambers date from around 650 to 300 B.C.\nOffering a full description of each piece, including typology, style, chronology, provenance, condition, and iconography, the catalogue is preceded by a general introduction to ancient amber. Through exquisite visual examples and vivid excerpts from classical texts, this book examines the myths and legends woven around amber—its employment in magic and medicine, its transport and carving, and its incorporation into jewelry, amulets, and other objects of prestige.\nThis open-access catalogue is available for free online and in multiple formats for download, including PDF, MOBI/Kindle, and EPUB. A paperback reference edition is also available for purchase.\nCitation Information Chicago Causey, Faya. Ancient Carved Ambers in the J. Paul Getty Museum. Los Angeles: J.
