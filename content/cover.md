*Ancient Carved Ambers in the J. Paul Getty Museum* is the first of several planned online scholarly collection catalogues from the Getty. The J. Paul Getty Museum and Getty Publications are committed to making available scholarly information on objects in the Museumâ€™s collections through this series of online catalogues. Each one provides a general introduction, scholarly commentary on the featured objects, and high-definition images that allow users to zoom in to view the object in full detail.
